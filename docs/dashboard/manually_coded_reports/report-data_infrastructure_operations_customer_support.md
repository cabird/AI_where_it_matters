## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Triage, deflection & rep co-pilot for known issues

Participants consistently describe wanting AI "behind the scenes" to reduce repetitive toil: parsing ticket text and logs, screening and bucketing requests, detecting recurring patterns, auto-replying to FAQs or driving self-service, and assisting human reps with suggested responses. The research description captures this aim: "Use AI behind the scenes to reduce toil: parse tickets/logs, screen & bucket, detect patterns, auto-reply to FAQs/self-service, and assist reps." In practice developers imagine AI that reads incoming support requests and makes sensible triage decisions so humans can focus on higher-value or unusual cases. One participant summarized this need simply: "If an AI agent could actually look at customer support request text and logs and make screening, bucketing, and triage decisions based on the content, that would be super helpful." (Participant PID89). Another described the desire to detect and reply to common patterns directly: "customer support. we got a lot of repetitive customer question, like permission issue. I hope AI can detect common pattern of our customer request triaging and reply to customer directly." (Participant PID114). Participants generally expect this functionality to operate as an efficiency layer that reduces repetitive workload while preserving human oversight and control over complex or brand-sensitive interactions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Triage, deflection & rep co-pilot for known issues**: Use AI behind the scenes to reduce toil: parse tickets/logs, screen & bucket, detect patterns, auto-reply to FAQs/self-service, and assist reps.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID89, PID114, P195 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"If an AI agent could actually look at customer support request text and logs and make screening, bucketing, and triage decisions based on the content, that would be super helpful."* (Participant PID89)
- *"customer support. we got a lot of repetitive customer question, like permission issue. I hope AI can detect common pattern of our customer request triaging and reply to customer directly."* (Participant PID114)
- *"Customer service: Self-service for well-known issues; Be an assistant for customer service reps."* (Participant P195)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Process customer requests

This theme overlaps with triage but emphasizes the end-to-end processing of requests—routing, classifying, and enabling automated resolution where appropriate. The manual coding pairs the same illustrative quotes used for triage, indicating developers view "process customer requests" as a practical extension of triage: once a request is parsed and classified, AI can trigger self-service flows or draft replies. The context is operational efficiency—freeing human reps from high-volume, low-complexity tickets—while ensuring more complex tickets are escalated.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Process customer requests**: 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID89, PID114 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"If an AI agent could actually look at customer support request text and logs and make screening, bucketing, and triage decisions based on the content, that would be super helpful."* (Participant PID89)
- *"customer support. we got a lot of repetitive customer question, like permission issue. I hope AI can detect common pattern of our customer request triaging and reply to customer directly."* (Participant PID114)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: AI for customer reps

Developers want AI as a co-pilot that augments human agents' productivity—surfacing relevant knowledge, suggesting code or configuration fixes, and flagging anomalous metrics that might explain customer symptoms. The coding captures this: AI should be "an assistant for customer service reps" and provide coding or knowledge-base support. One respondent framed it as a coding assistant role: "Coding: Be a coding assistant" (Participant PID195). Another highlighted help through knowledge bases and by flagging metric aberrations to guide investigation: "Helping with Customer Service through knowledge bases and flagging aberrations in metrics" (Participant PID401). The desired outcome is faster, better-informed human responses rather than fully automated conversation handling.

Sub-themes identified:
- **AI for customer reps**: 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID195, PID401 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Coding: Be a coding assistant"* (Participant PID195)
- *"Helping with Customer Service through knowledge bases and flagging aberrations in metrics"* (Participant PID401)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Find patterns in metrics

A related but distinct desire is for AI to analyze operational metrics and detect patterns or anomalies that correlate with support volume or specific issues. The coded description and quote emphasize metric-based signals as inputs to support workflows: "Helping with Customer Service through knowledge bases and flagging aberrations in metrics" (Participant PID401). Developers imagine AI surfacing metric anomalies as early warning signs or to provide context for triage decisions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Find patterns in metrics**: 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID401 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Helping with Customer Service through knowledge bases and flagging aberrations in metrics"* (Participant PID401)

Confidence: Medium

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Human-led frontline support (empathy, control, brand)

Participants voiced strong reservations about AI taking direct, autonomous control of customer-facing interactions. The manual coding succinctly captures the stance: "Customer-facing interactions should feel human; avoid friction and brand risk. AI can assist passively, but a human must retain final send/approval." Respondents described a risk of customer frustration, brand damage, and loss of empathy if AI becomes the primary interface. One participant asked for AI to remain passive and provide prompts: "Customer support. As a customer, being forced to an AI is frustrating. I would prefer the AI tooling to be passive, but provide me (as the person providing customer to support) prompts on suggested resolutions or ways forward." (Participant PID2). Another warned broadly: "AI should not be handling customer support. Pushing this role to AI will cause customers frustration via generated responses and reduce the quality of our product support." (Participant PID41). Several participants insisted a human must be the one to hit "send": "AI cannot hit the ‘send message’ button: I as a human must pull the trigger (be it even to bulk messages)." (Participant PID62). The boundary is clear—assistive AI is acceptable; autonomous outbound communication is not.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Human-led frontline support (empathy, control, brand)**: Customer-facing interactions should feel human; avoid friction and brand risk. AI can assist passively, but a human must retain final send/approval.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID2, PID41, PID62, P89, P170, P269 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Customer support. As a customer, being forced to an AI is frustrating. I would prefer the AI tooling to be passive, but provide me (as the person providing customer to support) prompts on suggested resolutions or ways forward."* (Participant PID2)
- *"AI should not be handling customer support. Pushing this role to AI will cause customers frustration via generated responses and reduce the quality of our product support."* (Participant PID41)
- *"AI cannot hit the ‘send message’ button: I as a human must pull the trigger (be it even to bulk messages)."* (Participant PID62)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Contextual customer engineering (not automatable)

Some support work is highly contextual, bespoke, and entwined with customer teams’ environments and organizational structures. The manual coding states: "Deeply contextual, bespoke work with customer teams requires human expertise and judgment." One participant described daily, hands-on interactions with customer development and leadership that they believe cannot be replaced by AI: "The customer support that I provide cannot be done by AI. I work directly with the customer's development team and leadership every day to develop the solutions that operate within their Azure environments. It's a hands-on-keyboard role." (Participant PID393). The implication is that AI may assist with information retrieval or routine tasks, but cannot replace relationship-building, negotiation, or bespoke engineering work.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Contextual customer engineering (not automatable)**: Deeply contextual, bespoke work with customer teams requires human expertise and judgment.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID393 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"The customer support that I provide cannot be done by AI. I work directly with the customer's development team and leadership every day to develop the solutions that operate within their Azure environments. It's a hands-on-keyboard role."* (Participant PID393)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Humans handle customers

This code reiterates a simple, repeated sentiment: customer contact should be handled by humans. The manual coding grouped similar quotes expressing frustration with forced AI interactions and preference for AI to be passive and assistive. The motivation is to preserve customer satisfaction and service quality; the boundary is that AI should not replace human-to-human interactions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Humans handle customers**: 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID2, PID41 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Customer support. As a customer, being forced to an AI is frustrating. I would prefer the AI tooling to be passive, but provide me (as the person providing customer to support) prompts on suggested resolutions or ways forward."* (Participant PID2)
- *"AI should not be handling customer support. Pushing this role to AI will cause customers frustration via generated responses and reduce the quality of our product support."* (Participant PID41)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Human oversight

Participants emphasized the need for human review and final approval—especially for outbound messages or bulk operations. The coded description notes this oversight preference. One succinct quote captures the requirement: "AI cannot hit the 'send message' button: I as a human must pull the trigger (be it even to bulk messages)." (Participant PID62). The implied design condition is that AI should recommend and draft, but humans must confirm and own customer communications.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Human oversight**: 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PID62 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"AI cannot hit the 'send message' button: I as a human must pull the trigger (be it even to bulk messages)."* (Participant PID62)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to reduce repetitive work—triage, bucket, draft replies, and surface metric anomalies—yet they strongly resist handing AI the customer-facing, empathetic role. The "want" themes focus on back-office efficiency and augmentation; the "don't want" themes focus on preserving human judgment, empathy, and brand control.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is conditional and clearly defined. AI is acceptable when it (a) operates behind the scenes, (b) reduces toil by automating repetitive classification or draft replies for well-known issues, (c) surfaces relevant context from logs and metrics, and (d) remains under human review before any customer-facing message is sent. These boundaries are repeatedly stated across themes.

- Task-specific nuances: Customer Support uniquely combines structured tasks (classification, FAQ responses, metric anomaly detection) that are highly automatable, with unstructured, relational tasks (customer engineering, escalation, leadership engagement) that require human judgment. This duality explains why participants simultaneously ask for automation and resist it: different sub-tasks within support have different automability.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust hinges on transparency, accuracy, and human finality. Participants are willing to accept AI suggestions if they can verify and control outcomes. The insistence that AI "cannot hit the send button" reflects a desire for predictable, auditable human control over communications that affect customers and brand reputation.

---

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives that contradict dominant themes: A small number of participants insisted AI cannot perform their support role at all (PID393), emphasizing hands-on engineering and leadership interaction that they deem non-automatable.

- Unique insights that don't fit neatly: The "Find patterns in metrics" code (PID401) points to a proactive, analytics-driven use of AI that sits between operations and support: using metric anomalies to prioritize or contextualize customer tickets. This is less about conversation automation and more about operational triage—an area with high potential but distinct from draft reply automation.

- Ambivalent responses: Several respondents want AI assistance for drafting and triage but simultaneously express fear of brand damage and customer frustration if AI messages are used directly—showing conditional optimism rather than absolute endorsement.

- Contradictions within individuals: While there are repeated themes across different participants, the dataset shows participants sometimes appearing in both "want" and "don't want" groups (e.g., similar PIDs across themes), reflecting nuanced views: they want AI to help but object to full automation. This reflects a consistent internal trade-off rather than an outright contradiction.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI to be an efficiency-boosting co-pilot that handles structured, repetitive tasks and surfaces context from logs and metrics—while preserving human judgment, empathy, and control for customer-facing interactions. Tools must therefore differentiate between automatable subprocesses and human-centric functions, provide transparent reasoning, and enforce human approval for outbound communications.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Triage & classification engine**
  - Capability: Parse ticket text and logs to classify, bucket, and prioritize incoming requests automatically.
  - Rationale: Participants repeatedly asked for screening and bucketing to reduce repetitive triage work. ("If an AI agent could actually look at customer support request text and logs and make screening, bucketing, and triage decisions..." — PID89)

- **Self-service/FAQ deflection workflows**
  - Capability: Detect well-known issues and surface or send guided self-service flows (with human-reviewed templates).
  - Rationale: Developers want AI to auto-reply or steer customers toward self-service for common permission or configuration issues. ("...we got a lot of repetitive customer question, like permission issue. I hope AI can detect common pattern..." — PID114)

- **Agent co-pilot with knowledge retrieval**
  - Capability: Suggest responses, relevant KB articles, configuration snippets, and code examples to support agents during response composition.
  - Rationale: Participants want assistance that augments human reps—e.g., "Coding: Be a coding assistant" (PID195) and knowledge-base surfacing (PID401).

- **Metrics-based anomaly detection**
  - Capability: Analyze operational metrics and flag aberrations that correlate with support incidents to inform triage.
  - Rationale: AI that surfaces metric anomalies helps link infra signals to customer tickets. ("...flagging aberrations in metrics" — PID401)

- **Human-in-the-loop controls and explainability**
  - Capability: Require human approval for outbound messages, show confidence scores and rationale for suggestions, and provide traceable decision logs.
  - Rationale: Strong insistence that AI be passive and that humans retain the final send. ("AI cannot hit the 'send message' button..." — PID62)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **No autonomous customer-facing messaging**
  - Risk: Brand damage and customer frustration from AI-generated messages sent without human review.
  - Rationale: Clear participant opposition to AI handling customer support outbound. ("AI should not be handling customer support..." — PID41)

- **No replacement of contextual customer engineering**
  - Risk: Loss of bespoke, high-value work that requires human judgment, hands-on debugging, and leadership engagement.
  - Rationale: Some roles involve deep, contextual collaboration that participants say "cannot be done by AI." (PID393)

- **No opaque decision-making**
  - Risk: Loss of trust if AI suggestions are unexplained and lead to errors in customer handling.
  - Rationale: Participants want to understand triage and suggested responses before acting on them.

- **No overreliance on automated bulk sends**
  - Risk: Small errors at scale could harm many customers; participants object to AI automatically triggering bulk communications. ("I as a human must pull the trigger (be it even to bulk messages)." — PID62)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop escalation: AI handles detection, classification, and draft creation; a human reviews and sends. This satisfies efficiency desires while preserving empathy and brand control.

- Confidence-threshold automation: Allow fully automated responses only for very high-confidence, low-risk cases (e.g., password resets, documentation links). All medium/low-confidence cases require human sign-off.

- Explainable suggestions: Present suggested replies alongside the evidence (extracted logs, KB links, metric anomalies) so agents can quickly validate or modify responses.

- Role-based controls: Provide admins the ability to tune automation aggressiveness per customer segment, enabling stricter human control for high-touch or enterprise accounts.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to automate structured support tasks—triage, bucketing, FAQ deflection, drafting replies, and surfacing metric anomalies—to reduce repetitive toil and speed resolution.
- Developers do not want AI to replace human-led, customer-facing interactions or context-rich customer engineering; human final approval is a consistent requirement.
- Design implication: Build AI as a transparent, explainable co-pilot with strong human-in-the-loop controls and confidence-based automation thresholds.
- Operational implication: Prioritize features that parse logs, detect patterns in metrics, suggest KB-relevant content, and draft responses for agent review.
- Notable tension: A single support workflow includes both highly automatable tasks and deeply contextual, relationship-driven tasks—tools must separate and treat them differently.
- Recommendation: Deploy incremental automation—start with classification, metric-flagging, and draft assistance—while enforcing mandatory human review for customer-facing messages to preserve trust and brand.
