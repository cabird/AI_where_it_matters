## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency / Rote Task Automation

Developers consistently want AI to relieve them of repetitive, well-defined maintenance and refactoring tasks so they can focus on higher-value work. The code "Routine well-defined maintenance, dependency, & version updates" captures this desire: participants imagine AI automating package and dependency upgrades, security patches, boilerplate generation, style changes across many files, and creation or mimicry of test code when strong CI exists. The motivation is pragmatic — save time on tedious, error-prone operations and reduce manual drudgery — and the desired outcome is uninterrupted developer productivity and fewer low-value tasks consuming engineering hours. Several participants emphasize that these tasks are "well-defined" and thus amenable to automation, but they also acknowledge that multi-file effects and proper testing (CI) are required to make automatic changes safe.

Boundaries and conditions are notable: participants expect AI to operate where changes are predictable and easily validated (e.g., dependency updates, stylistic changes, boilerplate), and they imply AI should integrate with testing infrastructure so regressions are caught. The desire is not for unchecked autonomy but for tools that reduce manual effort while integrating into existing validation workflows.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Routine well-defined maintenance, dependency, & version updates**: AI takes over boring, repetitive, well-defined refactor and maintenance tasks so developers can focus on higher-value work. AI automates package updates, security patches, and regular maintenance tasks. AI performs upgrades of libraries, packages, and dependencies with minimal disruption.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 1, 26, 62, 193, 203, 262, 294, 313, 319, 375, 228, 173 → 12; rounded to nearest 5 = 10)

Representative quotes:
- "Refactoring for sure. It's often the most boring task for me, and being able to mostly automate it would be amazing. Current progress is already great for a lot of use cases." (Participant 1)
- "Refactoring would be the biggest help! It's almost always tedious and well-defined tasks. Frequently it needs more than just find-replace though. Almost always it is over large file and multi-file workflows." (Participant 26)
- "Refactoring: tedious but easy to test (assuming strong CI a.k.a. Continuous integration testing)." (Participant 62)
- "Rote maintenance like package/dotnet updates, writing and executing novel tests that ensure no regressions, monitoring of production workloads for bugs and anomalies that need attention" (Participant 173)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

Developers expect AI to manage coordinated changes across a codebase rather than only operate in isolated files. The code "Coordinated multi-file/multi-module changes" encapsulates this expectation: participants want AI to understand dependencies, architecture, and relationships between files so a single intentional change (e.g., datatype change, nullability change) can be propagated consistently. The motivation is minimizing manual propagation and preventing drift or mismatches across modules and layers. Developers see value in AI that can find related files, reason about how code spread across many files composes, and help with re-architecture support.

Boundaries include the need for accurate cross-file reasoning and architectural awareness; participants imply that without holistic context the AI could introduce inconsistencies. They want AI to make coordinated suggestions, not unilateral restructurings, and to surface where human review is needed.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Coordinated multi-file/multi-module changes**: AI applies changes across large, interconnected codebases with understanding of dependencies and architecture.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 2, 47, 332 → 3; rounded to nearest 5 = 5)

Representative quotes:
- "More cross-codebase awareness, so I can make a single change in a small part of the codebase (eg changing a datatype in a model, or changing nullability of a field), and AI will help implement those changes across the rest of the codebase. Supporting re-architecture of my codebase." (Participant 2)
- "Improvements in understanding large code bases and drawing architectural conclusions will be necessary for making good decisions at the class level. Multi-step changes across boundaries for large code bases is necessary in our environment." (Participant 47)
- "AI should know which files are related to the code. AI should also know what the code that is spread across these files is doing. Also AI should be able to find the files that are used in context to the currently open files." (Participant 332)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Quality, Performance, and Security Enhancements

Participants want AI to help enforce coding quality and organizational best practices as part of refactoring and maintenance. The code "Enforcing coding standards and best practices" reflects expectations that AI can detect bad coding patterns, suggest or apply best-practice refactors, and automate unit test generation and review suggestions (including alignment with organizational or cloud-specific standards like Azure/MSFT mentioned by one participant). The context is that many maintenance updates are opportunities to raise code quality, strengthen tests, and align to performance and security expectations without sole reliance on manual reviews.

Boundaries include ensuring AI recommendations align with team style guides and platform-specific standards; participants want AI to be aware of organizational norms and to surface suggestions rather than silently rewriting according to a one-size-fits-all view.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Enforcing coding standards and best practices**: AI detects poor coding practices and suggests improvements to align with standards.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 21, 164, 354 → 3; rounded to nearest 5 = 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Help identify bad coding practices." (Participant 21)
- "automation of refactoring and unit tests; coding best practices suggestions during reviews" (Participant 164)
- "in terms on coding, and writing unit test cases , it also is aware of the overall azure, msft and coding standards so it should check that in coding and docs" (Participant 354)

Confidence: Low

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Developers repeatedly assert that final responsibility for refactors must remain with humans. The shared description makes clear that many are skeptical about complete automation — they fear AI will overreach and make structural changes that were not intended. The concern centers on ownership and accountability: because humans are ultimately responsible for production systems, they want to retain control over decisions that change code structure, file organization, imports, or create new artifacts. The empirical quotes reflect experiences where small requested changes turned into broad, unexpected transformations; this fuels preferences for interactive, consultative AI behavior rather than autonomous agents performing large-scale changes.

Boundaries are explicit: avoid AI-initiated structural or large changes without explicit human review/consent. Participants welcome feedback and suggestions (akin to a code reviewer) but reject handing over end-to-end handling of refactors.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Humans are skeptical about complete refactor automation. They prefer to keep the final responsibility because of the fear that AI will overreach even for small changes, introducing unnecessary complexity or unwanted modifications. Avoid AI making structural or large changes (e.g., new files, major rewrites) without explicit human review.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 39, 182, 18, 167 → 4; rounded to nearest 5 = 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first. ... next thing I know there are new classes and new files and I'm like 'No, just write the subroutine, do not change the entire codebase.'" (Participant 39)
- "AI should not perform any large-scale refactoring or optimizations." (Participant 182)
- "I do not want AI agents to add, remove, and heavily change my code structure, like new files, new subfolders, adding imports, etc." (Participant 18)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

Developers express low trust in AI's correctness and performance when it comes to refactoring. Under the code "Low trust in performance/correctness," participants describe experiences where AI-generated refactors required more time to review or fix than doing the work manually; some report AI being "really bad" at refactoring or producing incorrect changes that are costly to reverse. The fear is that AI could introduce subtle bugs or inefficient code, and when AI changes large portions of code at once, the review burden becomes large. This erodes confidence in letting AI act autonomously on refactors.

Boundaries include restricting AI to changes with easy validation or providing mechanisms that make correctness easy to verify (e.g., small atomic edits, strong test coverage). Participants want tools that reduce review overhead rather than increase it.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Low trust in performance/correctness**: Low trust in AI for refactoring because of concerns related to the correctness/performance.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 325, 385, 159, 35 → 4; rounded to nearest 5 = 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I can't trust the AI to be correct, and when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing or even fixing the AI's changes" (Participant 325)
- "I do not want AI handling tasks where precision is important or where correctness is more difficult to validate than just doing it myself..." (Participant 385)
- "Refactoring - AI tends to be really bad at this and I'm very opinionated." (Participant 159)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

Participants worry that AI lacks the holistic, domain-specific, and tribal knowledge required for safe refactoring across complex codebases. The description captures the concern that AI cannot always be provided with sufficient context to make correct, multi-step changes: domain knowledge, architectural rationale, and implicit conventions are often not encoded in the repository. Participants prefer to handle changes that need that deeper understanding themselves rather than rely on AI that might lack necessary context.

Boundaries include limiting AI involvement to contexts where the repository contains adequate context, or where AI can request clarifying information. For system-wide features and complex refactors that depend on non-local knowledge, participants prefer human-led work.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Concern that AI lacks holistic understanding of architecture, cross-file dependencies, and nuanced decisions.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 204, 259, 361 → 3; rounded to nearest 5 = 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I prefer not to use AI for tasks where I can't provide sufficient context. ... making a code change in a large repository that needs a comprehensive understanding of extensive code segments spread throughout the repo. ... if the code change requires specialized domain knowledge or tribal knowledge not found within the repository, I'd rather handle it myself." (Participant 204)
- "Complex refactoring's and anything not boilerplate." (Participant 259)
- "Refactoring a system wide feature, AI won't do it correctly." (Participant 361)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to automate routine, well-scoped refactorings (updates, style, boilerplate) and to help coordinate multi-file changes, but the same participants express strong reservations about delegating responsibility for structural, domain-sensitive, or high-risk refactors. In short, there is a clear complementarity: AI is welcome for predictable, easily testable updates; it is mistrusted for complex, contextual, or large-scale rewrites.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Conditions frequently cited include strong CI/test coverage, the ability to preview and approve changes, explicit scoping of transformations, traceability of related edits, and human oversight for structural decisions. Participants repeatedly tied confidence in AI to the availability of automated validation and obvious boundaries on AI autonomy.

- Task-specific nuances: Refactoring Maintenance Updates are distinct from other coding assistance because they often require cross-file consistency, knowledge of dependency graphs, and awareness of architectural trade-offs. Unlike single-function completion or small API usage help, maintenance updates can ripple across modules and deployment; this amplifies both the value of automation and the risk of introducing hidden regressions.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is situational — it increases when changes are small, testable, and transparent; it collapses when AI produces sweeping modifications without clear rationale. Developers favor human-in-the-loop patterns: AI as a proposer (or assistant) rather than an actor. Control demands range from fine-grained approvals to outright refusal of AI autonomy on structural changes. Explainability, small atomic edits, and integration with CI are trust-building levers.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives: A small number of participants suggested AI could do more than rote tasks — for example, supporting re-architecture or handling multi-step boundary-crossing changes (Participant 2 and 47). These participants are more willing to grant AI broader cross-file responsibilities provided it has architectural awareness.

- Unique insights: One participant emphasized that refactors are "easy to test" assuming strong CI (Participant 62). This suggests an actionable pathway: invest in testing and CI to widen the set of changes developers will entrust to AI.

- Ambivalent responses: Several participants expressed both enthusiasm and caution in a single comment (e.g., they want automation for tedious parts but reject AI making structural changes). Participant 167 explicitly welcomes AI feedback like a human reviewer but refuses to hand over accountability — a hybrid stance that favors advisory AI.

- Contradictions within individuals: Some participants simultaneously praised AI's current progress ("Current progress is already great") and reported slow or counterproductive experiences with AI-based refactors elsewhere ("Large refactors have been very slow and almost more time consuming"). This reflects heterogeneous experience with different tools and contexts.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Overall synthesis: Developers want AI that reduces busywork and enforces quality while preserving human accountability and minimizing risk. Tools must therefore be conservative by default, context-aware, and integrate tightly with validation pipelines and approval workflows. The central design challenge is to maximize time savings on safe tasks while minimizing the chance of introducing regressions or unwanted structural changes.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Scoped, predictable automation**
  - Capability: Allow users to restrict AI changes to well-defined categories (e.g., package updates, stylistic changes, boilerplate) and provide templates for safe refactors.
  - Rationale: Participants repeatedly asked for automation of "boring" but well-defined tasks (Routine well-defined maintenance...).
  - Example: "Refactoring for sure. It's often the most boring task for me..." (Participant 1)

- **Cross-file dependency analysis and impact visualization**
  - Capability: Analyze and display affected files, call graphs, and dependency hops before applying changes; offer coordinated multi-file edits with traceable mappings.
  - Rationale: Developers want "coordinated multi-file/multi-module changes" and visibility into what will change.
  - Example: "AI should know which files are related to the code..." (Participant 332)

- **Human-in-the-loop workflows with granular approvals**
  - Capability: Present diffs and grouped change proposals, allow selective acceptance/rejection, and require explicit authorization for structural changes (new files, folders, heavy rewrites).
  - Rationale: Participants demand oversight and reject autonomous structural modifications.
  - Example: "I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first." (Participant 39)

- **CI/test integration and verification tooling**
  - Capability: Automatically run and surface test results for proposed refactors, integrate with existing CI to validate changes before merge.
  - Rationale: Trust increases when changes are "easy to test"; CI provides safety net for larger automated edits.
  - Example: "Refactoring: tedious but easy to test (assuming strong CI a.k.a. Continuous integration testing)." (Participant 62)

- **Standards-aware suggestions and explainability**
  - Capability: Suggest fixes aligned to team or platform standards (e.g., Azure/MSFT), include rationale and mapping to style guides, and provide human-readable explanations for transformations.
  - Rationale: Participants expect AI to enforce coding standards and justify changes.
  - Example: "automation of refactoring and unit tests; coding best practices suggestions during reviews" (Participant 164)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous structural rewriting**
  - Risk: Unsupervised creation/deletion of files, folders, or major architectural changes that alter repository structure without consent.
  - Rationale: Multiple participants objected to AI adding/removing files or making heavy structural edits.
  - Example: "I do not want AI agents to add, remove, and heavily change my code structure..." (Participant 18)

- **Blind multi-file edits without impact traceability**
  - Risk: Applying broad changes without showing dependency chains or reasoning increases review cost and reduces trust.
  - Rationale: Participants reported that when AI "changes too much code at once" it costs them more time.
  - Example: "when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing..." (Participant 325)

- **Opaque suggestions lacking tests or explainability**
  - Risk: Changes that cannot be validated or explained will be rejected or require manual rework.
  - Rationale: Participants want explainable, testable modifications; otherwise AI decreases developer efficiency.
  - Example: "I do not want AI handling tasks where precision is important..." (Participant 385)

- **Overreliance without domain/context acquisition**
  - Risk: Letting AI act in areas where repository and tribal knowledge are insufficient risks incorrect refactors.
  - Rationale: Domain-specific and context-heavy refactors were cited as inappropriate for AI.
  - Example: "If the code change requires specialized domain knowledge or tribal knowledge ... I'd rather handle it myself." (Participant 204)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop with progressive autonomy: Start with suggestion-only mode; enable one-click application for small categories (style, deps) once a project has sufficient test coverage. For larger changes require multi-stage approvals and gated CI validation.

- Scoped transformation templates + impact preview: Allow users to select a "refactor scope" (single file, module, repo-wide), then visualize affected artifacts and provide an automated test-run summary so reviewers can make informed acceptance decisions.

- Explainable change logs and provenance: For each automated edit, show the reasoning, linked tests, and a mapped list of related code paths. This reduces perceived risk and aids auditing/rollbacks.

- Confidence thresholds and "canary" application: Apply low-risk changes automatically (e.g., formatting), but propose high-risk changes as pull requests for staged rollouts and monitoring.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI for routine, well-defined refactors (dependency upgrades, boilerplate, style) because it saves time and reduces drudgery.
- Developers do not want AI to autonomously perform large-scale or structural refactors; they insist on human accountability and explicit review.
- Critical design implication: tools must be conservative by default, provide scoped automation, and integrate with CI to validate changes.
- Another critical implication: tooling must surface cross-file impact analysis and explainability so reviewers can trust and approve coordinated edits.
- Notable tension: developers want both automation (to reduce tedious work) and control (to avoid unexpected structural changes); design patterns like human-in-the-loop and scoped previews resolve this.
- Recommendation: prioritize features that enable safe, testable automation (scoped edits, CI integration, diffs/explanations) and enforce guardrails that prevent opaque or autonomous structural modifications.
