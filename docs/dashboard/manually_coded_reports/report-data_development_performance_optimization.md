## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency

Developers express a clear desire for AI to improve routine aspects of code performance work that are time-consuming or error-prone. Under the code "Code optimization and efficiency improvements" (AI improves code performance, efficiency, and compliance with standards, including reducing unnecessary code and handling large datasets effectively), participants imagine AI as an accelerator: doing intelligent code reviews, generating tests, suggesting refactors, and ensuring repository standards are met. The motivation is pragmatic — free engineers to focus on higher-level design, speed up delivery, and reduce mechanical errors. For example, one participant asked for AI to play "a bigger role in intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, and architectural decision support" to "accelerate delivery while maintaining high quality and consistency" (Participant 9). Others want fewer lines of code and "more cognitive reasoning capabilities" from tools (Participant 29).

Participants framed expectations in outcome terms: improved performance, compliance with team standards, and handling large datasets efficiently. They also noted boundaries — AI should be precise, minimize errors, and proactively cover concerns like accessibility, performance, and security rather than introducing noisy suggestions. One participant succinctly captured this desire: "I'd really like it if AI helps me make sure the code I'm writing meets repository standards, handles the size of data I'm processing efficiently, and helps me understand dependencies upstream and downstream" (Participant 39).

Sub-themes identified:
- **Code optimization and efficiency improvements**: AI improves code performance, efficiency, and compliance with standards, including reducing unnecessary code and handling large datasets effectively.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 9, 29, 39, 110, 114, 122, 330, 333, 334; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Over the next 1-3 years, I’d like AI to play a bigger role in intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, and architectural decision support."* (Participant 9)
- *"Reducing lines of codes and enabling more cognitive reasoning capabilities"* (Participant 29)
- *"I'd really like it if AI helps me make sure the code I'm writing meets repository standards, handles the size of data I'm processing efficiently..."* (Participant 39)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

Developers also want AI that understands context across codebases, dependencies, and non-functional requirements so suggestions are relevant rather than generic. The code "Context-aware performance recommendations" (AI suggests optimizations tailored to the specific codebase, dependencies, and usage patterns, ensuring relevance and accuracy) captures requests for AI to propose design-pattern-appropriate implementations, reusability improvements, and suggestions on non-functional requirements. Participants envision real-time, scenario-aware guidance — for example, an assistant that recommends how to execute a task "faster and more secure" based on the project's specific constraints (Participant 349), or one that helps with "design pattern implementation based on scenario" and "suggestions on non-functional requirements" (Participant 272).

The motivation is to avoid one-size-fits-all recommendations that don't apply to a project's architecture or runtime characteristics. Boundaries include the need for AI to tie suggestions to the actual system’s dependencies and usage patterns, and to offer optimizations that are actionable within the team's design goals. Representative participants asked for accelerating boilerplate code while also "suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early in the development cycle" (Participant 172).

Sub-themes identified:
- **Context-aware performance recommendations**: AI suggests optimizations tailored to the specific codebase, dependencies, and usage patterns, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 172, 272, 349, 403; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"I want AI to assist most in accelerating boilerplate code generation, suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early in the development cycle."* (Participant 172)
- *"1. Design pattern implementation based on scenario 2. Reusability 3. Suggestions on non-functional requirements"* (Participant 272)
- *"Optimization. I want AI to identify how to execute the tasks I am working on faster and more secure."* (Participant 349)

Confidence: Low

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

Participants explicitly resisted delegating performance optimization to AI when it requires deep, system-level understanding. Under the code "Lack of Deep Context and System Understanding" (Belief that performance optimization needs nuanced understanding of architecture, trade-offs, and domain knowledge that AI does not yet have), respondents argued that architectural-level optimizations and trade-off analysis need human judgment. They expressed concern that AI may generate changes that are hard to understand or build upon, especially when optimization decisions depend on interactions between services or runtime constraints. One participant stated plainly: "I might not want AI to directly perform performance optimization, as it sometimes doesn't have the necessary context and ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon" (Participant 269). Another emphasized that performance work "often needs deep context about the system, trade-offs, and real-time constraints that are hard to generalize" and preferred team-led decisions (Participant 301). A third participant noted that current models "lack the vision of the 'big picture' needed for architectural optimization" (Participant 345).

The boundary is clear: AI can assist with localized code-level suggestions, but developers want humans to lead architecture-level performance decisions that require holistic system insight.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Lack of Deep Context and System Understanding**: Belief that performance optimization needs nuanced understanding of architecture, trade-offs, and domain knowledge that AI does not yet have.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 269, 301, 345; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"I might not want AI to directly perform performance optimization, as it sometimes doesn't have the necessary context and ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon."* (Participant 269)
- *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle performance optimization. It often needs deep context about the system, trade-offs, and real-time constraints..."* (Participant 301)
- *"…current Gen AI models like GPT lack the vision of the 'big picture' needed for architectural optimization."* (Participant 345)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

Developers worry that AI-driven optimizations could introduce bugs or subtle regressions that are difficult to detect. The code "Risk of Introducing Bugs or Regressions" (Concern that AI optimizations may break existing functionality or cause subtle, hard-to-detect performance regressions) reflects fears that automated optimizations might apply changes with unintended side effects or unsafe default settings. One participant warned that "these changes need to be thoroughly investigated and tested; a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems" (Participant 164). Another expressed reluctance to let AI handle bug fixes or performance tweaks because "I don't want a fix to break something else" and subtle details are sometimes missed when others (or AI) make changes (Participant 318).

The implication is a strong preference for conservative AI behavior: suggestions only, clear rationale for changes, and tooling that supports verification and rollback. Developers want to avoid opaque, fully automatic modifications to performance-sensitive code paths.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Risk of Introducing Bugs or Regressions**: Concern that AI optimizations may break existing functionality or cause subtle, hard-to-detect performance regressions.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PIDs: 164, 318; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"performance optimization: these changes need to be thoroughly investigated and tested; a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems"* (Participant 164)
- *"Bug fixes and performance optimisation, since I dont want a fix to break something else. And it is sometimes difficult to catch subtle details when we're not the ones writing/guiding the code."* (Participant 318)

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Developers emphasized that final responsibility for performance decisions must remain with humans; AI should assist but not decide. Although no separate code name was listed under this theme, the description states developers want final authority over performance decisions to ensure responsibility and alignment with system goals. Participants want AI to provide suggestions, but humans must make the final call because engineers are the ones who can be held accountable and who understand iterative trade-offs over multiple iterations. One participant summarized: "I would like AI to assist and help in suggestions but what actually goes into should be decided by the Engineer who knows the system in and out and can hold responsibility if anything goes down" (Participant 299).

The boundary here is explicit: AI as advisor, not executor. Developers want transparent, reviewable suggestions and clear ownership for any changes applied.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers want final authority over performance decisions to ensure responsibility and alignment with system goals.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PIDs: 299; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Coding/Programming and Performance Optimization, I would like AI to assist and help in suggestions but what actually goes into should be decided by the Engineer..."* (Participant 299)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Professional Identity & Craftsmanship/Skill Preservation

Some participants resist AI taking over performance optimization because they view it as a core, rewarding craft. The description (Developers value performance optimization as a high-skill, rewarding part of their role that they prefer to keep human-led) reflects identity and intrinsic motivation — optimizations are a source of satisfaction and professional growth. One participant stated simply: "I dont want AI to handle performance optimization or AI development, as they bring satisfaction to my work, and needs craftsmanship" (Participant 285).

This is less about technical capability and more about preserving skill, ownership, and the professional pride associated with solving complex optimization problems. AI designs that remove the learning opportunities or the sense of mastery may face resistance.

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Participants want AI to automate repetitive, well-scoped tasks (code-level refactors, tests, and reviews) while explicitly rejecting AI-led system-level optimizations that require holistic architectural understanding. The "want" themes emphasize operational efficiency and context-aware suggestions; the "don't want" themes emphasize the risks when AI lacks system-level context or accountability. These positions are complementary — developers want AI to augment, not supplant, human expertise.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI hinges on clear conditions: suggestions (not autonomous changes), context-awareness tied to the codebase, transparent rationales for recommendations, and robust testing/verification paths. Multiple quotes stress that AI should "assist" and that "what actually goes in should be decided by the Engineer" (Participant 299), indicating conditional trust.

- Task-specific nuances: Performance Optimization is uniquely sensitive to system-level trade-offs, non-functional requirements, and emergent interactions between services. Unlike simple bug fixes, performance tuning can introduce regressions and requires measuring real-world effects, making developers more conservative about automation. The tension between local (function-level) and global (architecture-level) optimization recurs across themes.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is calibrated — developers are willing to accept AI contributions when they are transparent, reversible, and well-contextualized. Control must remain with engineers for final decisions. There is also an emotional component: preserving craftsmanship and learning matters; tools that displace skillful work may be resisted even if technically feasible.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives that contradict dominant themes: A few participants suggested AI involvement even in higher-level decisions (e.g., architectural decision support in Participant 9's quote), indicating some openness to AI contributing to architecture if it can provide high-quality, contextualized reasoning. This contrasts with those insisting AI lacks "big picture" vision.

- Unique insights that don't fit neatly: Some responses combined desires for automation and high trust simultaneously — e.g., asking for automated test generation and architectural decision support while also wanting strict oversight. These hybrid responses suggest developers envision graduated AI capabilities rather than a binary assist-or-replace model.

- Ambivalent responses: Several participants expressed both interest in AI helping with performance tasks and concern about regressions. For example, requests for "real-time performance optimization suggestions" coexist with worries that "a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems" (Participant 164). This ambivalence underscores the need for conservative defaults and verification tooling.

- Contradictions within individuals: No explicit single-participant contradictions were coded in the provided quotes, but the dataset contains participants who want AI for "architectural decision support" and others who say AI lacks big-picture vision — indicating divergent expectations of AI capability across respondents.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI that speeds up code-level performance work and offers context-aware recommendations, but they require transparent, reviewable, and reversible suggestions. Tools should be designed to augment engineering judgment, preserve opportunities for learning and craftsmanship, surface trade-offs explicitly, and embed verification workflows (tests, benchmarks, canary rollouts) before any change reaches production.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Context-aware recommendation engine**
  - Capability: Analyze the specific codebase, dependency graph, runtime characteristics, and non-functional requirements to tailor optimization suggestions.
  - Rationale: Participants want "design pattern implementation based on scenario" and suggestions tied to reusability and non-functional requirements (Participant 272).

- **Explainable change rationale**
  - Capability: For each suggested optimization, provide a concise explanation of why it improves performance, what trade-offs it introduces, and the assumptions made.
  - Rationale: Developers worry about opaque changes and want to understand the "why" before applying suggestions (Participant 269).

- **Suggestion-first, not auto-change**
  - Capability: Default to proposing changes with clear diffs and tests rather than automatically applying modifications; require explicit human approval for any code committed.
  - Rationale: Multiple responses demanded human final authority and accountability ("should be decided by the Engineer..." — Participant 299).

- **Integrated verification and testing workflows**
  - Capability: Automatically generate regression tests, benchmarks, and recommended rollout strategies (e.g., canary testing) tied to each optimization suggestion.
  - Rationale: Concerns about subtle regressions and the need to "thoroughly investigate and test" changes (Participant 164).

- **Granular configuration and guardrails**
  - Capability: Let teams configure the scope of AI suggestions (e.g., function-level only, no architectural changes) and enforce project-specific coding/performance standards.
  - Rationale: Developers want AI that respects repository standards and handles data-size concerns appropriately (Participant 39).

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous architectural reworks**
  - Risk: AI making large-scale architecture changes without human oversight can break systems and remove human accountability.
  - Example: Participants explicitly reject AI handling architecture-level performance optimization, saying models "lack the vision of the 'big picture'" (Participant 345).

- **Opaque, unexplained optimizations**
  - Risk: Applying changes without rationale increases debugging cost and reduces trust.
  - Example: Concern that AI "ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon" (Participant 269).

- **Removing opportunity for human craftsmanship**
  - Risk: Tools that completely automate optimization will reduce engineers’ learning and satisfaction.
  - Example: "I dont want AI to handle performance optimization... they bring satisfaction to my work, and needs craftsmanship" (Participant 285).

- **Default aggressive changes without testing**
  - Risk: Immediate deployment of AI-suggested changes without generating tests or benchmarks risks regressions.
  - Example: Warnings that "a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems" (Participant 164).

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Review-and-Explain pattern: AI produces a suggested change with an explainable rationale, associated benchmarks, auto-generated tests, and a “safety score.” Engineers review, tweak, and approve. This pattern balances automation and human oversight.

- Scoped Optimization pattern: Allow teams to set scopes (e.g., "function-level refactor only", "no cross-service changes"). AI respects scope and escalates suggestions that exceed it with a confidence indicator and recommended human reviewers.

- Iterative Assist pattern: For architecture-level suggestions, AI presents multiple lightweight options with trade-offs and simulated outcomes; engineers iteratively select and refine rather than accepting a single automatic change.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI for code-level performance tasks: intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, and targeted refactoring to improve efficiency and standards compliance.
- Developers do not want AI to autonomously perform architecture-level optimizations or make unreviewed changes because these require holistic system understanding and accountability.
- Critical design implication: tools must be context-aware, explainable, and suggestion-first — provide actionable recommendations with rationale and verification artifacts.
- Critical design implication: incorporate verification workflows (benchmarks, tests, canary strategies) and configurability so teams control scope and risk.
- Notable tension: developers want automation to save time but simultaneously fear regressions and loss of craftsmanship; design must preserve learning opportunities and final human control.
- Recommendation: build AI features that produce explainable, scoped, test-backed suggestions and workflows that require human signoff for any production change.
