## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Personalized Learning Guide

Developers envision AI as a patient, adaptive tutor that can build learning pathways tailored to their current knowledge and learning pace. The coded description (Code: 1.0) frames AI as a tutor/coach that adapts to the user’s level, provides safe Q&A, and builds personalized learning paths. Participants described wanting a tool that "walks me through tutorials, providing helpful examples" and that can "build my concepts from ground up" so they can progress from simple to complex topics. Several emphasized the value of asking "embarrassing" or basic questions without judgment — "Being able to ask a specific question about a new technology without self-concern and get an expert and specific response back is transformative in the learning process" (PID 122).

At the same time, participants framed boundaries: the AI should simplify explanations to an appropriate level and then scale up to more complex responses when requested ("It should concisely see what I'm talking about in what context and give on point answers… simplify it to a good level and then when asked complicated questions, it should confidently and concisely answer." PID 380). The desired outcomes are increased learning efficiency, confidence-building through safe Q&A, and customized learning plans rather than one-size-fits-all content.

Sub-themes identified:
- **1.0**: AI as a tutor/coach that adapts to the user’s level, provides safe Q&A, and builds personalized learning paths. It enables progression from simple to complex concepts and allows developers to ask “embarrassing” questions without judgment.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PIDs: 122, 169, 269, 281, 380)

Representative quotes:
- *"Being able to ask a specific question about a new technology without self-concern and get an expert and specific response back is transformative in the learning process."* (Participant 122)
- *"Help me learn new technologies by walking me through tutorials, providing helpful examples, or pointing me toward a path of learning."* (Participant 169)
- *"One prompt should give me a response that builds my concepts from ground up. More like a personal course based on my learning abilities."* (Participant 281)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Resource for Hands-on & On-the-Job Learning

Participants want AI to support active, practice-based learning—helping them find resources, set up exercises, and assist during onboarding and on-the-job tasks—without replacing the essential hands-on component. The coded description (Code: 2.0) highlights AI’s role in gathering resources, guiding practical exercises, offering onboarding support, and giving concrete examples. This reflects a use-case where AI reduces friction (e.g., finding documentation, giving sample exercises) while preserving developer agency: "Helping me gather the resources to learn more effectively on the job" (PID 25).

Several respondents warned against AI doing the work for them and thereby depriving them of learning-by-doing ("It is not so great at actually learning new techs as it does the work for you and you miss a chance to learn by doing." PID 66). Desired outcomes include streamlined access to hands-on materials (exercises, tutorials, onboarding content), and practical scaffolding that augments rather than substitutes experiential learning.

Sub-themes identified:
- **2.0**: AI supports active, practice-based learning: gathering resources, guiding exercises, onboarding support, and practical examples. Developers emphasize the importance of not replacing hands-on experience.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PIDs: 25, 66, 71, 157, 180, 195 — rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Helping me gather the resources to learn more effectively on the job."* (Participant 25)
- *"Exercises to learn new coding languages and tech within AI agents instead of reading books or online tutorials."* (Participant 71)
- *"It is not so great at actually learning new techs as it does the work for you and you miss a chance to learn by doing."* (Participant 66)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Information Synthesis for Learning Support

Developers want AI to act as a meta-layer that filters, collates, and summarizes the vast and fast-moving landscape of tools and documentation, helping them stay aware of relevant new technologies and keep documentation current. The coded description (Code: 3.0) frames AI as an assistant that surfaces new tech, summarizes references, and helps write or maintain documentation from source code. Users imagine notifications like "Notify me when a new technology related with my daily work or my interests comes out (with a brief summary with references)." (PID 72) and assistance with "writing documentation from source code" (PID 142).

The motivation is efficiency and signal-to-noise improvement: rather than individually discovering scattered resources, developers want synthesized, curated entry points, and ongoing surfacing of developments that matter to their work. Boundaries again appear: synthesized information must be accurate and actionable to be useful for learning rather than misleading.

Sub-themes identified:
- **3.0**: AI assists by filtering, collating, and summarizing resources, keeping documentation updated, and surfacing relevant new technologies to support learning. It provides a meta-layer that scaffolds learning with synthesized information.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PIDs: 72, 142, 202, 333, 392)

Representative quotes:
- *"Notify me when a new technology related with my daily work or my interests comes out (with a brief summary with references)."* (Participant 72)
- *"Help me find new tools and learnings, help with writing documentation from source code."* (Participant 142)
- *"Providing useful resources for learning new technologies and maintaining quality documentation."* (Participant 202)

Confidence: Medium

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Balance over Automation (Hands-on Learning)

Developers are cautious about AI replacing the experiential core of learning. The manual description indicates a clear preference for "learn by doing": many respondents explicitly rejected AI that substitutes hands-on practice. For example, "I don't want AI to replace the hands-on part of learning new technologies. Just like reading isn't a substitute for trying something." (PID 39) and "Learning new technologies… should be learn by doing, not by watching." (PID 66). The feared outcome is passive, shallow knowledge if tools do the work for them.

Participants framed a boundary rather than an outright ban: AI can support learning but should not supplant the tasks that produce durable understanding. They insist that ultimately "Learning – it needs to be me that learns." (PID 198), signaling insistence on ownership of skill acquisition.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers value experiential, active learning and reject AI replacing that process. They want to practice, explore, and “learn by doing,” not watch or delegate learning to AI.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PIDs: 39, 66, 198 — rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"I don't want AI to replace the hands-on part of learning new technologies. Just like reading isn't a substitute for trying something."* (Participant 39)
- *"Learning new technologies… should be learn by doing, not by watching."* (Participant 66)
- *"Learning – it needs to be me that learns."* (Participant 198)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Quality and Trust Issues

A prominent concern is that AI outputs may be incorrect, outdated, or unverifiable, making them unsafe as primary learning sources. The manual description captures this distrust: participants noted difficulty verifying AI-generated content "without pre-existing knowledge" (PID 28) and emphasized that "AI is not reliable" for nuanced learning (PID 44). One respondent explicitly linked this to training data recency: "It would struggle with new technologies without good training data." (PID 193). The feared outcome is learning incorrect practices or stale approaches, which can propagate errors into applied work.

Participants want accuracy and currency as preconditions for trusting AI as a learning aid ("For learning new technologies, AI needs to be first accurate and current." PID 375). This theme sets a high bar for any design that aims to replace or even supplement authoritative documentation.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI is seen as unreliable, outdated, or inaccurate for learning new technologies. Developers distrust its ability to provide correct or timely information.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (PIDs: 28, 44, 193, 220, 375)

Representative quotes:
- *"AI will not be helpful because it's hard to verify the accuracy… without pre-existing knowledge."* (Participant 28)
- *"Learning new technologies requires nuanced knowledge and AI is not reliable…"* (Participant 44)
- *"For learning new technologies, AI needs to be first accurate and current."* (Participant 375)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Lack of Nuance / Limited Help with New Tech

Developers worried that AI lacks the deep, nuanced, up-to-date understanding required for advanced or cutting-edge technologies. The coded description emphasizes that AI "lacks deep or nuanced understanding of new and emerging technologies, limiting its usefulness for advanced or cutting-edge learning." Participants noted that nuanced knowledge is essential and that AI may "struggle with new technologies without good training data" (PID 193). This concern overlaps with Quality and Trust Issues but focuses specifically on limitations in domain depth and emergent-tech awareness.

The implication is that AI may be useful for entry-level or summary tasks but not for complex, research-level learning where subtleties matter.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers note that AI lacks deep or nuanced understanding of new and emerging technologies, limiting its usefulness for advanced or cutting-edge learning.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (PIDs: 44, 193 — rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Learning new technologies requires nuanced knowledge and AI is not reliable…"* (Participant 44)
- *"It would struggle with new technologies without good training data."* (Participant 193)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Desire for Control and Verification

Some developers prefer to retain manual ownership of learning so they can independently verify approaches and responsibly apply new technologies. The description states developers want to "learn themselves so they can validate and deeply understand new technologies before applying them responsibly." For instance, a participant noted they want AI to "help make this more efficient" but still to handle learning themselves (PID 25), while another explicitly said they want to "verify that we are using them correctly…" (PID 271). This reflects a desire for tools that assist without obviating human verification and judgment.

Boundaries here include an expectation that AI should support efficiency while enabling human-led validation and accountability.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers prefer to learn themselves so they can validate and deeply understand new technologies before applying them responsibly.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (PIDs: 25, 271 — rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Learning new technologies, but I want AI to help make this more efficient."* (Participant 25)
- *"I would like to handle learning new technologies myself, so that I can verify that we are using them correctly…"* (Participant 271)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Across the "want" themes developers want AI that reduces friction—curating resources, synthesizing information, and providing personalized, scaffolded learning—while they simultaneously fear AI stepping in for the essential, hands-on practice. The desire for personalized guidance (Code 1.0) and synthesis (Code 3.0) complements hands-on support (Code 2.0), but all coexist with worries about automation eroding experiential learning and about output quality.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Participants repeatedly set preconditions: AI must be accurate, current, and transparent; it must enable rather than replace practice; and it should support verification. Statements like "AI needs to be first accurate and current" (PID 375) and "Learning – it needs to be me that learns" (PID 198) capture this conditionality.

- Task-specific nuances: Learning New Technologies differs from routine coding tasks because it requires both breadth (keeping up with new tools) and depth (nuanced understanding of design and trade-offs). This drives two distinct AI roles: a synthesis/curation role for breadth, and a tutoring/coach role for scaffolding depth—neither of which should fully automate experiential practice.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust hinges on verifiability and currency. Where participants see AI as a "safe" tutor (Code 1.0), they also want mechanisms to confirm accuracy. Control shows up as a desire to retain final responsibility for learning outcomes and verification, not relinquish it to an AI agent.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Contradictory individual views: A few participants appear in both "want" and "don't want" themes (e.g., PID 66 and PID 25), expressing nuanced positions: they want AI to help (gather resources, streamline learning) but reject AI that substitutes practice. This ambivalence suggests many developers view AI as a conditional assistant, not a replacement.

- Minority emphasis on onboarding automation: Some responders (PIDs 157, 180) specifically cited onboarding and documentation as areas where AI could substantially help—this is a concrete, lower-risk locus for AI adoption compared to cutting-edge research tasks.

- Ambivalent quotes: Statements like "Learning new technologies, but I want AI to help make this more efficient." (PID 25) show blended attitudes—positive about assistance for efficiency but insisting on human-led understanding and verification.

- Limited evidence for full automation acceptance: No participants unequivocally endorsed AI fully automating the learning process; even positive responses included explicit boundaries about hands-on practice and verification.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI tools that accelerate and scaffold learning without displacing the experiential activities that produce deep understanding. Tools should focus on personalized tutoring, curated practical resources, and trustworthy synthesis, while embedding mechanisms for verification, transparency, and user control.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Personalized Learning Paths & Adaptive Tutoring (Code: 1.0)**
  - Capability: Generate stepwise, adaptive learning plans that start from a user’s declared level and incrementally introduce complexity; provide safe, non-judgmental Q&A that explains concepts clearly and scales depth on demand.
  - Rationale: Participants want AI "like a personal course" that "builds concepts from ground up" (PID 281) and allows asking "embarrassing" questions safely (PID 122).

- **Hands-on Exercise Generation & On-the-Job Scaffolding (Code: 2.0)**
  - Capability: Produce concrete exercises, mini-projects, and onboarding checklists with runnable examples and guided walkthroughs that encourage practice rather than passive consumption.
  - Rationale: Developers emphasized exercises and onboarding support (PIDs 71, 157) and warned against AI doing the work for them (PID 66).

- **Curated Synthesis & Change Notifications (Code: 3.0)**
  - Capability: Monitor selected technology areas and notify users of relevant new tools or updates with concise summaries and source references; synthesize documentation and code comments into digestible learning resources.
  - Rationale: Participants requested "Notify me when a new technology related with my daily work or my interests comes out (with a brief summary with references)" (PID 72) and help "writing documentation from source code" (PID 142).

- **Verifiability & Source Attribution**
  - Capability: Always include verifiable sources, confidence indicators, and links to primary docs; provide provenance and timestamps to indicate currency of knowledge.
  - Rationale: Trust concerns centered on accuracy and recency (PIDs 28, 193, 375).

- **Interactive, Incremental Feedback**
  - Capability: Provide interactive prompts that ask the learner to attempt a small task, then give targeted feedback rather than complete solutions, preserving learning-by-doing.
  - Rationale: Prevents AI from replacing practice while still offering corrective guidance (related to PIDs 66, 39).

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Do Not Fully Automate Learning Tasks**
  - Risk: Replacing hands-on practice with AI-generated solutions leads to shallow mastery ("it does the work for you and you miss a chance to learn by doing." PID 66).
  - Guardrail: Avoid one-click solutions that produce fully worked implementations without opportunities for user practice and feedback.

- **Do Not Omit Source Attribution or Currency**
  - Risk: Unattributed or stale recommendations erode trust and can propagate incorrect practices ("it’s hard to verify the accuracy… without pre-existing knowledge." PID 28).
  - Guardrail: Require provenance metadata and recentness indicators for any factual claims or suggested technologies.

- **Do Not Present High-Confidence Claims Without Uncertainty Labels**
  - Risk: Overconfident AI responses can mislead learners about nuances or emerging limitations ("AI is not reliable…" PID 44).
  - Guardrail: Surface confidence scores, known limitations, and links to deeper references, especially for advanced topics.

- **Do Not Remove Human-in-the-Loop Verification**
  - Risk: Delegating critical validation to AI undermines responsible adoption ("I would like to handle learning new technologies myself, so that I can verify…" PID 271).
  - Guardrail: Design workflows that require or easily allow human review before applying technology decisions.

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Guided Practice Pattern: Combine generated exercises with "attempt-first" workflows—AI provides a prompt or scaffold, the user attempts the task, then AI gives incremental feedback and hints. This pattern preserves hands-on learning while leveraging AI tutoring.

- Source-Backed Summaries Pattern: For synthesis features, always include a short summary plus annotated links to primary sources and a recency timestamp. When information is uncertain, label it and suggest how the user can verify (e.g., run a reproducible example).

- Adaptive Transparency Pattern: Allow users to set desired levels of automation and depth (e.g., "Explain like I'm 10", "Show advanced trade-offs", "Provide runnable example only after I try"). This provides control and matches varying preferences for guidance vs. independence.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to be a personalized tutor and curator—building adaptive learning paths, surfacing relevant new technologies, and generating practical exercises—while not replacing hands-on practice.
- The main places developers do not want AI are where it would automate experiential learning, provide unverified or stale guidance, or obscure nuanced, cutting-edge trade-offs.
- Designers must prioritize verifiability (provenance, timestamps), adaptive tutoring that scales depth, and features that generate hands-on practice and incremental feedback.
- Guardrails should prevent full automation of learning tasks, require source attribution, surface uncertainty, and preserve human verification.
- Key tension: developers want efficiency and synthesis from AI but insist on retaining control and doing the hands-on work that produces durable expertise.
- Recommendation: build AI learning tools that are explicitly human-in-the-loop—scaffolding practice, citing sources, and offering adjustable automation levels—so AI accelerates, rather than replaces, developer learning.
