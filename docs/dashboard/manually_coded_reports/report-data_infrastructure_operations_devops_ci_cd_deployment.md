## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Telemetry-driven triage, anomaly detection & release risk

Participants want AI to use logs, metrics, and test errors to speed up troubleshooting, detect anomalies, predict failures, and inform release decisions. The researchers’ description — "Use logs/metrics/test errors to pinpoint issues, predict failures, and gate releases (safe/unsafe to deploy)" — matches respondent requests for an assistant that reduces time-to-diagnosis and helps decide when it is safe to deploy. Requests cluster around automated analysis and triage: reading CI/CD logs, surfacing likely root causes, and flagging risky releases. While participants welcome proactive risk detection, they typically imply this should inform human decisions rather than replace them.

Participants position these capabilities as diagnostic and advisory: they want the AI to "assist in analyzing logs, metrics, test errors" and to "detect safe/unsafe time to deploy," enabling faster, evidence-driven human decisions rather than blind automation.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Telemetry-driven triage, anomaly detection & release risk**: Use logs/metrics/test errors to pinpoint issues, predict failures, and gate releases (safe/unsafe to deploy).

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 102, 202, 195 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Troubleshooting deployment issues." (Participant 102)
- "To read the log in CI/CD, and provide analysis of the bugs in code." (Participant 202)
- "Debugging: Assist in analyzing logs, metrics, test errors." (Participant 195)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Pipeline bootstrapping, synthesis & quality review

Developers want AI help standing up, repairing, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines—especially where documentation is poor or systems are complex. The research description — "Stand up/repair complex or poorly documented CI/CD; generate/modify pipelines; review/optimize configs; support local pipeline testing; enforce fundamentals" — captures multiple requests: generate or modify pipeline configuration, help test pipelines locally, review and refactor existing pipeline code, and enforce good CI/CD practices. Participants name specific pain points like opaque, poorly documented systems (e.g., OneBranch) and ask for AI that can reduce friction in onboarding and maintenance while improving pipeline quality.

Desired outcomes include accelerated pipeline bootstrap, reduced manual trial-and-error, and higher-quality, maintainable configurations. Some quotes indicate AI should also provide optimization suggestions and support automated system testing integrations. Boundaries are implicit: AI help is primarily for authoring, repair, and local validation — not necessarily for unsupervised production execution.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Pipeline bootstrapping, synthesis & quality review**: Stand up/repair complex or poorly documented CI/CD; generate/modify pipelines; review/optimize configs; support local pipeline testing; enforce fundamentals.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 41, 122, 259, 195, 360, 393 → 6 rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Help set up OneBranch CI/CD… notoriously poorly documented and hard to figure out." (Participant 41)
- "Develop CI/CD pipelines to address complex issue sets." (Participant 122)
- "Help with testing/deploying pipelines locally… enable using AI here." (Participant 259)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Automate operational toil & deployments

Participants want AI to remove repetitive, time-consuming manual steps in deployments and operational maintenance. The coded description — "Remove long manual steps, manage alerts/monitors, and run unattended/overnight deployments to reduce ops friction" — reflects desires for tooling that minimizes human toil: automating routine deploy steps, alert and monitor setup, and scheduling non-critical deployments overnight.

Motivation is clear: free engineers from predictable, error-prone manual tasks so they can focus on higher-value work. Some participants go further, expressing a wish for broad CI/CD automation, but other codes show that this desire for automation is tempered by concerns about unsupervised production actions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Automate operational toil & deployments**: Remove long manual steps, manage alerts/monitors, and run unattended/overnight deployments to reduce ops friction.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 108, 333, 135, 159 → 4 rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Remove long manual processes." (Participant 108)
- "Managing both CI/CD and Alerts and monitors setup." (Participant 333)
- "Automated deployments overnight." (Participant 135)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: AI for learning

One participant explicitly highlights AI’s role in accelerating human learning and development rather than replacing it. The coded description was not restated in full beyond quotes, but the core idea is that AI should enhance engineers’ ability and learning rate while keeping humans central.

This reflects a user-facing boundary: AI should be an educational scaffold that preserves pathways for junior engineers to gain operational intuition, rather than a crutch that erodes hands-on skill development.

Sub-themes identified:
- **AI for learning**: (see quote) — AI should enhance engineers’ abilities and rate of learning without replacing the human imperative to understand systems.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 16 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "I want AI to enhance human engineer's ability WHILE increasing the rate at which human engineers learn and develop. The human should always be paramount..." (Participant 16)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Automate ops

This theme reiterates the desire for AI assistance in configuring and developing CI/CD pipelines and automating CI/CD work more broadly. The description from coding overlaps substantially with other automation themes: "AI could be useful in helping set up OneBranch CI/CD pipelines... I want AI to be able to develop CI/CD pipelines to address complex issue sets... I'd love for AI to automate all CI/CD work."

Here the motivation is maximizing efficiency and reducing frustration with poorly documented or complex internal systems. Boundaries are not explicit in these quotes, but the broader dataset shows participants want control over production effects.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Automate ops**: (implicit) Use AI to help set up and develop CI/CD pipelines and automate CI/CD tasks.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 41, 122, 159 → 3 rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "AI could be useful in helping set up OneBranch CI/CD pipelines..." (Participant 41)
- "I want AI to be able to develop CI/CD pipelines to address complex issue sets." (Participant 122)
- "I'd love for AI to automate all CI/CD work." (Participant 159)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Toil

A focused, small cluster emphasizes removing repetitive toil. The code description is simple: "Remove long manual processes." This overlaps with the Automate operational toil theme but is worth noting as a concise expression of frustration with mundane tasks.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Toil**: (explicit) Remove long manual processes.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 108 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "Remove long manual processes" (Participant 108)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Predict failure

Participants want AI to act as a coding and CI/CD assistant that can review configurations and predict unsafe deployment windows. The coded description emphasizes using AI to "Detect safe/unsafe time to deploy." This is closely tied to the telemetry/triage requests but emphasizes predictive gating—forecasting likely failures or risky times for release.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Predict failure**: (implicit) Use AI to predict failures and detect safe/unsafe times to deploy based on code and CI/CD signals.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 195 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "CI/CD: Review code/configuration; Detect safe/unsafe time to deploy" (Participant 195)

Confidence: Low

---

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: No unsupervised production actions (deploys, live changes, final releases)

Developers consistently reject AI performing unsupervised production actions. The research description — "Anything that touches prod stays behind human gates—no auto-deploys, no direct live changes, no unsupervised publishing." — captures a dominant boundary: AI may suggest, prepare, or run pre-prod steps, but final production deployments, live changes, and final release publishing must remain human-controlled. Concerns center on the high-impact nature of production mistakes: misconfigurations or unreviewed changes can cause outages, harm customers, and damage reputation.

Participants stressed human review and approval as essential for production touches, indicating a strong preference for AI as an assistant rather than an autonomous actor when safety-critical systems are involved.

Sub-themes identified:
- **No unsupervised production actions (deploys, live changes, final releases)**: Anything that touches prod stays behind human gates—no auto-deploys, no direct live changes, no unsupervised publishing.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 19, 21, 90, 123, 135, 161, 259, 309, 362 → 9 rounded to nearest 5 yields 10)

Representative quotes:
- "Production deployments due to the impact that a misconfiguration could have." (Participant 19)
- "Automatically deploy without user review." (Participant 21)
- "I dont want AI to handle final deployment approvals for production environments…" (Participant 309)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Human-gated change control & security-critical work

Developers want human intermediaries for change requests and any security-related fixes. The coded description — "Change requests and security/deployment fixes need human intermediaries; reject blind auto-fix loops." — reflects concern that AI-initiated or -approved changes could introduce regressions or miss contextual constraints that a human on-call would understand.

Participants explicitly reject AI creating or approving change requests without human oversight and are cautious about allowing AI to directly remediate security or deployment issues without human verification.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Human-gated change control & security-critical work**: Change requests and security/deployment fixes need human intermediaries; reject blind auto-fix loops.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 122, 264, 253 → 3 rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI to handle creating or approving change requests without a human intermediary…" (Participant 122)
- "Maybe any security related or deployment related fixes." (Participant 264)
- "Automatic building and testing, then fix bugs according to the error messages until all the errors are fixed." (Participant 253)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Trust, reliability & transparency concerns

Participants worry that AI must prove itself reliable, safe, and transparent before being entrusted with DevOps tasks. The coded description — "Don’t hand DevOps to AI unless it’s demonstrably reliable, safe, and transparent." — summarizes this sentiment. Respondents said activities that cannot be "fully and reliably handled by AI" should remain manual, and CI/CD should not be delegated to AI until there is evidence of safety and reliability.

These concerns often motivate the demand for explainability, audit trails, and conservative defaults that favor human control.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Trust, reliability & transparency concerns**: Don’t hand DevOps to AI unless it’s demonstrably reliable, safe, and transparent.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PIDs: 44, 342 → 2 rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "Any activity which cannot be fully and reliably handled by AI should not be done by AI." (Participant 44)
- "DevOps (CI/CD) / Deployment shouldn't be handled by AI until it's proven to be more reliable and safe." (Participant 342)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Protect operational intuition

One participant emphasized that over-automation risks depriving junior engineers of exposure needed to develop higher-level ops judgment. The coded description — "Avoid over-automation engineers need exposure to build high-level ops judgment." — frames AI as a potential threat to skill development if used as a crutch that hides system complexity.

This is a boundary condition for designers: AI should be educational and supportive, not a replacement for hands-on learning.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Protect operational intuition**: Avoid over-automation engineers need exposure to build high-level ops judgment.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 16 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "Engineers still need to learn how things work… I want AI to guide and assist human engineer development, not replace lower experience engineers..." (Participant 16)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Human understanding

Closely related to the prior theme, one participant argued that every environment is different; the path to building intuition takes time and AI should not short-circuit that learning. The coded description reiterates that AI must assist learning rather than replace it, especially for junior and mid-level operations engineers.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Human understanding**: (implicit) AI should not replace the experiential learning needed to develop high-level operational problem-solving.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 16 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "Even if AI produced 100% accurate and contextual solutions... the engineer won't learn how things work to solve high level operational problems." (Participant 16)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Deployment

This theme aggregates multiple deployment-related safety concerns and overlaps with the first "No unsupervised production actions" theme. The description echoes earlier notes: participants explicitly call out production deployments, automatic deploys without review, and live changes as unacceptable AI actions until proven safe.

Deployment touches are repeatedly identified as high-stakes and needing human approval, testing, and final publication by humans.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Deployment**: (implicit) Production deployments and publishing final releases should not be done autonomously by AI.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 19, 21, 123, 135, 161, 259, 264, 309, 342 → 9 rounded to nearest 5 yields 10)

Representative quotes:
- "Production deployments due to the impact that a misconfiguration could have." (Participant 19)
- "Publishing the final release package… I would rather want it to be tested thoroughly and then a human can publish." (Participant 161)
- "I dont want AI to handle final deployment approvals for production environments..." (Participant 309)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Human oversight

Several participants insist on staying "human in the loop" for most DevOps tasks. The coded description — (implicit) insistence on human oversight — captures the sentiment: a single misstep could cause outages, reputational and financial loss, so human accountability and intervention are necessary.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Human oversight**: (implicit) Maintain human control and approval for DevOps actions.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 122, 135, 362 → 3 rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI to handle creating or approving change requests without a human intermediary..." (Participant 122)
- "I think I always want to be the human in the loop for most things DevOps related." (Participant 362)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Security

Security-related fixes and deployment changes are flagged as especially sensitive. The coded description — (implicit) security — underlines that AI-driven automatic fixes or approvals for security issues are not desirable without careful human mediation.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Security**: (implicit) Avoid AI-only remediation or approval for security-related changes.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (unique PID: 264 → rounded to nearest 5 yields 0)

Representative quotes:
- "Maybe any security related or deployment related Fixes." (Participant 264)

Confidence: Low

---

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers generally want AI to perform analysis, triage, pipeline generation, and toil reduction (telemetry-driven triage, pipeline bootstrapping, automate toil). At the same time, they consistently draw a hard line against autonomous production actions. The dataset shows a clear pattern: AI is welcome as an analytical, preparatory, and educational tool, but not as an autonomous agent in production.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance is strongly conditional. Common conditions include demonstrable reliability, transparency/explainability, human approval gates for production touches, audit trails, and the ability to test changes locally or in staging. Participants repeatedly demand that AI augment but not replace human judgment, especially for security and final releases.

- Task-specific nuances: CI/CD and deployment are high-stakes, context-specific workflows tightly coupled to environment, organizational processes, and customer impact. Unlike pure code generation tasks, DevOps actions can directly affect live systems and business operations; thus participants emphasize environment-specific constraints, risk prediction (safe/unsafe to deploy), and thorough testing before any production effect.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is granular: participants trust AI for information synthesis, log analysis, and pipeline suggestions but distrust it for autonomous execution in production. They expect strong human oversight, role-based approvals, and conservative automation defaults. Explainability and reproducible reasoning are prerequisites for expanding AI autonomy.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full automation desire: A minority (e.g., Participant 159) expresses enthusiasm for full automation ("I'd love for AI to automate all CI/CD work"). This contrasts sharply with many others who insist on human gates. Designers should expect both extremes and provide configurable levels of autonomy.

- Protection of learning: Participant 16 uniquely emphasizes AI as a learning accelerator and warns against depriving junior engineers of experience. This pedagogical stance is a distinct, non-technical requirement that suggests features like "explain why" and "guided learning mode."

- Ambivalence within individuals: Some participants both ask for automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., overnight deployments) and simultaneously state they "always want to be the human in the loop," indicating a desire for scheduled, supervised automation rather than fully autonomous operations.

- Overlapping codes: Several themes are semantically overlapping (e.g., Toil vs Automate operational toil; Automate ops vs Pipeline bootstrapping). This indicates developers express similar needs in multiple ways: pipeline setup, repetitive-step removal, and local testing support are part of a single practical problem cluster.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Designers should treat AI in DevOps CI/CD as an assistant focused on diagnostics, synthesis, and controlled automation. The prevailing user stance is "assist, explain, enable" rather than "act autonomously in prod." Tools that balance powerful automation with strong human controls, explainability, and learning support will align best with developer expectations.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Telemetry-driven analysis and triage**
  - Capability: Ingest CI/CD logs, metrics, and test outputs to surface root causes, anomalies, and likely failure modes; provide risk scoring for releases.
  - Rationale: Participants explicitly asked for log reading and analysis to accelerate troubleshooting and to "detect safe/unsafe time to deploy." (Participant 195, 202)

- **Pipeline bootstrapping and review assistant**
  - Capability: Generate or repair pipeline configs, suggest optimizations, and support local/staging testing of pipeline changes with contextual explanations.
  - Rationale: Requests to help set up poorly documented pipelines (OneBranch) and to "help with testing/deploying pipelines locally." (Participant 41, 259)

- **Safe, auditable automation of repetitive toil**
  - Capability: Automate repetitive steps (e.g., alert/monitor setup, nightly non-critical deployments) with scheduling, dry-run previews, and audit logs.
  - Rationale: Participants want to "remove long manual processes" and run "automated deployments overnight" while retaining oversight. (Participant 108, 135)

- **Human-in-the-loop gating and role-based approvals**
  - Capability: Always require human approval for production changes; support staged approvals, change request generation, and human review workflows.
  - Rationale: Strong demand that "anything that touches prod stays behind human gates." (Participant 19, 309)

- **Explainability and learning modes**
  - Capability: Provide contextual explanations of recommended changes, step-by-step reasoning, and a "learning mode" that teaches junior engineers why a change is recommended.
  - Rationale: Protect operational intuition and accelerate learning while preserving human understanding. (Participant 16)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **No unsupervised production deployments**
  - Risk: Autonomous deploys or live changes risk outages and customer harm.
  - Rationale/quote: "Production deployments due to the impact that a misconfiguration could have." (Participant 19)

- **No AI-only approval of change requests or security fixes**
  - Risk: Blind auto-fix loops can introduce unsafe changes.
  - Rationale/quote: "I don't want AI to handle creating or approving change requests without a human intermediary…" (Participant 122)

- **No opaque or unanalyzable actions**
  - Risk: Without explainability, teams cannot trust AI recommendations or learn from them.
  - Rationale/quote: "Any activity which cannot be fully and reliably handled by AI should not be done by AI." (Participant 44)

- **No removal of learning pathways**
  - Risk: Over-automation that hides details undermines skill development.
  - Rationale/quote: "Engineers still need to learn how things work… I want AI to guide and assist human engineer development, not replace..." (Participant 16)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop gating: Always present a clear human approval step for any action that affects production. Allow AI to prepare artifacts (change requests, deployment manifests) but require a human sign-off with an explainable justification.

- Staged automation: Support a graduated autonomy model—recommendation-only → assisted execution in staging → scheduled non-critical production runs → human-gated production—so teams can increase trust incrementally.

- Explainable dry-runs and replayable audits: Provide human-readable rationales, diffs, and the ability to run changes in a simulated or staging environment with full logs before any prod effect.

- Learning-first UX: Offer "guided mode" that explains recommended steps, shows what changed, and surfaces learning resources to preserve junior engineer growth.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI for diagnostics, pipeline generation/repair, and removing repetitive operational toil, especially via telemetry-driven triage and local pipeline testing.
- Developers do not want AI to perform unsupervised production deployments, live changes, or final release publishing; human gates are required for any prod touch.
- Critical design implication: prioritize explainability, audit trails, and human-in-the-loop approval flows over autonomous execution.
- Critical design implication: provide features that enable local/staging testing, risk scoring for releases, and pipeline bootstrapping to reduce friction while maintaining control.
- Notable tension: some users desire broad automation while others prioritize skill development and human oversight; a staged autonomy model helps resolve this.
- Recommendation: build configurable, auditable assistants that start as advisory tools (analysis, synthesis, test support) and expose explicit, explainable steps for any production action, reserving final control to humans.
