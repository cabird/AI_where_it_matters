## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency / Rote Task Automation

Developers want AI to shoulder repetitive, low-value, and time-consuming parts of debugging so humans can concentrate on creative, high-impact work. The manual coding describes this as AI taking over tedious or low-value bug-related tasks (e.g., setup, log gathering, searching related fixes). Participants envision AI handling routine chores like generating code templates, log analytics, cache invalidation, and auto-refactoring to bootstrap work and boost velocity. For example, one respondent framed this as “Having AI do a lot of repetitive grunge work. Leave me to do the fun coding ;-)” (PID 319), while another emphasized freeing up cognitive bandwidth: “Automating time-consuming tasks that require low cognitive load, freeing me up for tasks that require a higher cognitive load.” (PID 365).

Boundaries here are pragmatic: AI is expected to do boilerplate and data-heavy tasks but not replace the developer’s judgment on design or complex fixes. Several participants listed specific rote tasks they expect AI to automate (naming variables, cache invalidation, log gathering), highlighting that reliability and integration into existing workflows are prerequisites for adoption.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI takes over tedious or low-value bug-related tasks (e.g., setup, log gathering, searching related fixes) so developers can focus on creative, high-value work.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (8 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "Handle basic developmental tasks." (Participant 44)
- "Having AI do a lot of repetitive grunge work. Leave me to do the fun coding ;-)" (Participant 319)
- "Automating time-consuming tasks that require low cognitive load, freeing me up for tasks that require a higher cognitive load." (Participant 365)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Comprehension & Collaboration Support       - (Collaborative Debugging)

Participants want AI to act as a partner—an assistant that points out possible issues, validates choices, and helps developers reason about problems without taking control. The manual description frames AI as working alongside the developer, suggesting issues and solutions but not fully taking over. Developers want real-time, context-sensitive feedback (catching typos, code style, simple bugs) and collaboration that reduces context switching (e.g., giving algorithm definitions or examples instead of sending the developer to external sites).

Notable conditions include a preference for AI that asks clarifying questions, stays within the developer’s intent (“understand the target and do ONLY what I want” — PID 256), and improves its depth of analysis beyond surface-level suggestions. One participant emphasized this assistant role explicitly: “I want AI to point out where I could be wrong or identify potential problems for solutions that I face, not do everything for me based off of a one-sentence prompt. I thought we were building a Copilot not an AI Servant.” (PID 89).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI should work alongside the developer as a partner, suggesting possible issues and solutions without fully taking over.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (5 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I want AI to point out where I could be wrong or identify potential problems ... not do everything for me based off of a one-sentence prompt. I thought we were building a Copilot not an AI Servant." (Participant 89)
- "Act like an assistant to reaffirm correctness of algorithms and catch typos or simple bugs." (Participant 160)
- "understand the target and do ONLY what I want." (Participant 256)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

Code: Context-Aware Bug Detection & Fix

Developers expect AI debugging help to be context-aware across codebase, domain knowledge, and historical bug data—so suggestions and fixes match style, dependencies, and non-functional constraints (e.g., performance). The provided description emphasizes AI not only spotting bugs but proposing or applying fixes with awareness of project context. Participants imagine AI that can parse a complex unfamiliar repo and give reasonable suggestions or fully understand component interactions: “Bug fixing (or at least reasonable suggestions) in a complex code repository that I'm not familiar with.” (PID 202).

Motivations include speeding onboarding, reducing time spent hunting context, and surfacing tribal knowledge embedded in teams (“Domain knowledge sourced from tribal knowledge and memory based information, picking potential bugs” — PID 185). Developers also flagged challenges: AI must avoid endless loops, be concise, and surface actionable documentation or design patterns relevant to the observed problem.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Context-Aware Bug Detection & Fix**: AI bug-fixing help should account for codebase context, domain knowledge, and prior bug history for accurate diagnosis and fixes. AI not only spots bugs but proposes or applies fixes, with awareness of code style, dependencies, and performance considerations.

Number of participants: ~15 participants (15 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "AI needs understanding of context you are working in" (Participant 107)
- "Domain knowledge sourced from tribal knowledge and memory based information, picking potential bugs" (Participant 185)
- "Be able to fully understand the context, perform tasks concisely and efficiently, and avoid falling into an endless loop." (Participant 314)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: Background Quality and Standards Check

Code: Proactive Bug Detection & Mitigation

Here developers want AI to surface bugs proactively—during authoring, via continuous review, or as part of test pipelines—to prevent regressions and improve code quality. The description frames AI as identifying bugs while coding, offering real-time review feedback, and integrating with testing to catch issues early. Participants highlighted the desire for AI to accelerate boilerplate generation and provide context-aware optimizations while maintaining control over quality: “I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code! I want it to give me code review feedback in real time.” (PID 167).

Some participants anticipate AI should do much of the "code-level heavy lifting" while preserving developer ideation; others are more cautious and want AI to be an augmentation that accelerates testing and review rather than a full author of production code.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Proactive Bug Detection & Mitigation**: AI should identify bugs while coding, through real-time review, code analysis, or integration with testing pipelines to prevent regressions before they occur.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (4 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code! I want it to give me code review feedback in real time." (Participant 167)
- "I want AI to assist most in accelerating boilerplate code generation, suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early in the development cycle." (Participant 172)
- "Code should be bug free, only ideation should be mine. Rest all code level heavy lifting I would like to see by AI" (Participant 287)

Confidence: Low

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

Code: Understanding/ Complexity Limitations

Developers expressed reluctance to delegate complex, multi-system, or tacit-knowledge-dependent debugging to AI. The manual description states AI lacks deep project/system knowledge and tacit understanding necessary for navigating complex bugs. Participants pointed out that many coding decisions are informed by implicit domain knowledge, UX expectations, compliance considerations, and historical practices that are not explicit in code—areas where AI struggles. For example: “When coding, multiple steps of decisions are made per line ... often informed by implicit knowledge from working on the system for a period of time that isn't explicit from just the codebase.” (PID 10).

Security concerns and control issues also surfaced; one participant noted stepping through program state could be a security risk if AI had that level of machine access (PID 27). Developers do not want AI to make large, impactful changes that it cannot validate against the full system context.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Understanding/ Complexity Limitations**: AI lacks the deep project/system knowledge, tacit understanding, and ability to navigate complex, multi-system bugs effectively.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (6 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I want AI to be an assistant for scoped tasks with a defined outcome that can be easily validated... often informed by implicit knowledge from working on the system..." (Participant 10)
- "Debugging would be challenging since it would require AI to step through my program and understand the program state...this would be a bit of a security risk for an AI to have that level of control over my machine." (Participant 27)
- "I do not want AI to handle architectural decisions or deep debugging of complex systems. These requires context, domain expertise, and creative problem-solving..." (Participant 317)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

Code: Lack of Reliability & Trust / Avoid AI-caused Bugs

A dominant concern is that AI-generated fixes can be incorrect, incomplete, or overconfident, potentially introducing new bugs or technical debt. The manual description encapsulates this as AI producing incorrect or overconfident fixes that can cause harm or waste time. Multiple participants recounted concrete failure modes—hallucinations, wrong assumptions about business logic, or silly but dangerous mistakes (“wrote code that assumed that every month has 30 days” — PID 392).

Trust concerns extend to maintainability: AI-produced code that is unreadable or brittle increases long-term burden (“AI-generated code is often not very readable and maintainable” — PID 149). Many developers are comfortable with AI helping with search terms, syntax in unfamiliar languages, or small targeted refactors, but not with handing over root-cause analysis, performance optimizations, or large refactors without careful human oversight.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Lack of Reliability & Trust / Avoid AI-caused Bugs**: AI often produces incorrect, incomplete, or overconfident fixes, which can cause harm or waste time.

Number of participants: ~20 participants (21 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I prefer AI not handle core architectural decisions or debugging tricky issues ... AI can assist, but I want to stay in control..." (Participant 57)
- "Anything I can't trust, which is most of AI due to hallucinations" (Participant 98)
- "Debugging.. AI is very bad at understanding the context and throwing wrong answers with at most confidence , makes us waste time instead of helping with saving time" (Participant 215)

Confidence: High

---

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Code: (No code)

Participants emphasized that final decisions—especially for critical or ambiguous fixes—must remain human-led. The description highlights the need for human oversight and decision control in critical bug fixes. Respondents want AI to provide mitigation suggestions but require human review and sign-off before actions are taken in live systems. For instance, an on-call engineer said they “would not like AI to right away Mitigate the issue and would require Human intervention once the mitigation is ready by AI and AI as a judge can act in the process with human I would be fine with it being a judge companion with human.” (PID 209).

This theme overlaps with trust concerns: developers want AI to assist but not to be the final arbiter for changes that affect availability, correctness, or compliance.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Final decisions for critical bug fixes should remain human-led, especially in complex or high-impact scenarios.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (2 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I prefer AI not handle core architectural decisions or debugging tricky issues ... I want to stay in control of those calls." (Participant 57)
- "While I am DRI/On-call I would not like AI to right away Mitigate the issue and would require Human intervention once the mitigation is ready by AI..." (Participant 209)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Privacy, Security and Risk-Sensitive Areas

Code: Security-critical bug fixes

Developers explicitly do not want AI independently handling security-critical or compliance-sensitive bug fixes. The manual description warns against AI operating autonomously in these contexts because the stakes of missing a subtle vulnerability are high. Participants stressed that security tasks should either be human-led or, at most, AI-reviewed. One participant stated succinctly: “Critical Bug Fixes / Security critical tasks - The stakes of missing something critical can lead to a potential breach” (PID 37).

This boundary is strict: AI can be a reviewer or a helper for identifying suspicious patterns, but not an autonomous fixer in security contexts.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Security-critical bug fixes**: AI should not independently fix security-critical or compliance-sensitive bugs.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (5 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "Critical Bug Fixes / Security critical tasks - The stakes of missing something critical can lead to a potential breach" (Participant 37)
- "Anything pertaining to security shouldn't be handled by AI (but perhaps reviewed by it) to avoid subtle bugs that go unnoticed." (Participant 188)
- "Security because it would still need a human to do a thorough review" (Participant 408)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Professional Identity & Craftsmanship/Skill Preservation

Code: Enjoyment & Skill-building Preservation

Some developers resist AI for parts of debugging because those tasks are sources of enjoyment, learning, and professional growth. The description frames debugging as a skill-development activity that should not be fully ceded to AI. Participants expressed that relying too much on AI could erode individual learning and long-term developer competence. One participant captured this ambivalence: “I enjoy debugging and troubleshooting hard-to-fix errors... having an AI tool to help me would free up time for doing more of these!!” (PID 3), while another warned, “AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks that allow those engineers to become better engineers.” (PID 16).

Developers therefore prefer AI to augment learning (e.g., explain its reasoning) rather than replace the hands-on experience of debugging.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Enjoyment & Skill-building Preservation**: Developers value debugging for enjoyment, skill growth, and learning; they do not want AI to remove these opportunities.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (4 actual)

Representative quotes:
- "I enjoy debugging and troubleshooting hard-to-fix errors that span multiple systems. However, as much as I enjoy this, having an AI tool to help me would free up time for doing more of these!!" (Participant 3)
- "AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks that allow those engineers to become better engineers." (Participant 16)
- "I prefer to do debugging on my own before asking AI so that I can build understanding the code instead of completely relying on AI." (Participant 333)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to automate rote tasks, proactively detect bugs, and provide context-aware recommendations, but they are deeply concerned about AI’s reliability and lack of deep context. The two sets of themes complement each other: where AI can confidently reduce grunt work, developers welcome it; where AI lacks context or could introduce risk (security, architecture), they push back.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance is strongly conditional. Developers are comfortable with AI handling narrowly scoped, easily verifiable tasks (boilerplate, log parsing, simple refactors) and as a collaborative assistant. They resist autonomous action in high-impact, ambiguous, or security-critical situations. Requiring human sign-off and “explainability” are common conditions.

- Task-specific nuances: Bug Fixing Debugging is distinct from other dev tasks because it often requires deep, implicit knowledge (system state, multi-service interactions, business rules). Debugging also frequently involves on-call, time-sensitive decisions where incorrect automated actions can cause outages—raising higher stakes compared to e.g., documentation generation.

- Trust and control dynamics: The dataset shows developers want AI to augment cognition and reduce cognitive load but not supplant human judgment. Trust is earned by accuracy, context-awareness, conservative behavior (ask for confirmation), and clear provenance of recommendations. When AI expresses high confidence in low-quality outputs (hallucinations), trust erodes quickly.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Some participants are strongly optimistic that AI will soon handle full debugging in complex codebases (e.g., PID 44, PID 380), while many others explicitly caution against this until AI can reliably capture system context—showing a split between aspirational and pragmatic views.

- Ambivalent responses: A few respondents both enjoy debugging for learning and simultaneously want AI to free time for deeper debugging tasks (PID 3), suggesting design that supports both augmentation and opportunities for human practice.

- Contradictory notes within individuals: Some participants use AI for small-scale coding but explicitly distrust it for larger tasks, demonstrating differentiated trust by task size and impact. This indicates that acceptance is not binary but task-contingent.

- Rare security-focused comments: While most participants mentioned security as a boundary, a minority explicitly framed AI’s potential to assist in detection but not remediation—hinting at mixed roles where AI flags issues but humans remediate.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers’ responses point to AI tools that are assistive, context-aware, conservative in action, and transparent in reasoning. Tools should prioritize tasks where correctness is easy to validate and where AI reduces low-value effort, while offering clear boundaries and human-in-the-loop controls for riskier activities.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Rote Task Automation**
  - Capability: Automate boilerplate, log gathering/analysis, template generation, cache invalidation, and other repetitive diagnostic chores.
  - Rationale: Frees developers for higher-value debugging (e.g., “Having AI do a lot of repetitive grunge work. Leave me to do the fun coding ;-)” — PID 319).

- **Context-Aware Recommendations**
  - Capability: Incorporate repo history, team conventions, dependency graphs, and prior bug fixes to produce fixes aligned with project practices.
  - Rationale: Developers want fixes that respect style, performance, and domain constraints (“AI needs understanding of context you are working in” — PID 107).

- **Collaborative Assistant Mode**
  - Capability: Provide suggestions, ask clarifying questions, explain reasoning, and present multiple options rather than autonomously applying changes.
  - Rationale: Promotes trust and preserves developer control (“Act like an assistant to reaffirm correctness ...” — PID 160).

- **Proactive, Real-time Feedback**
  - Capability: Integrate with editors and CI to surface potential bugs and testing gaps early, coupled with actionable remediation steps.
  - Rationale: Early detection reduces regressions and manual fix work (“I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code!” — PID 167).

- **Explainability & Provenance**
  - Capability: Show why a recommendation is suggested (stack traces, evidence from prior fixes, confidence levels), and link to tests and impacted modules.
  - Rationale: Helps developers validate AI suggestions and avoid blind acceptance that leads to errors.

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous Fixing of Security-Critical Issues**
  - Risk: Autonomous remediation could miss subtle vulnerabilities and cause breaches.
  - Rationale: “Critical Bug Fixes / Security critical tasks - The stakes ...” (PID 37). Tools must require human review for security-related changes.

- **Unbounded Autonomous Changes in Production**
  - Risk: Unreviewed AI actions during on-call incidents can worsen outages.
  - Rationale: On-call engineers want human sign-off before mitigations are enacted (PID 209).

- **Opaque or Overconfident Suggestions**
  - Risk: Hallucinations and high-confidence incorrect fixes erode trust and waste time.
  - Rationale: “AI is very bad at understanding the context and throwing wrong answers with at most confidence” (PID 215). Avoid presenting suggestions without evidence or uncertainty.

- **Replacing Learning Opportunities**
  - Risk: Fully automating debugging can degrade developers’ skills over time.
  - Rationale: “AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks ...” (PID 16). Tools should support learning modes.

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-Loop Remediation: AI proposes fixes and auto-generates test cases or impact analyses, but enacts changes only after explicit human approval. This satisfies desires for efficiency while preserving accountability.

- Confidence-Weighted Suggestions with Evidence: Present fixes with confidence scores and linked evidence (stack traces, similar past fixes, failing tests). Low-confidence suggestions should be clearly flagged as exploratory.

- Scoped Automation: Offer “scoped action” modes (e.g., file-local, service-local) where AI is allowed to execute changes automatically only within low-risk bounds, otherwise require approvals. This balances speed for safe tasks and caution for risky ones.

- Learning-as-First-class Output: Provide explanations, interactive debugging walkthroughs, and rationale so AI becomes a tutor rather than just a code generator—preserving skill-building.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI that automates rote debugging work (logs, templates, simple refactors) and provides proactive, real-time bug detection to reduce low-value effort.
- They resist autonomous AI handling of complex, multi-system, security-critical, or high-impact debugging tasks due to context gaps and trust concerns.
- Critical design must-haves: context-aware recommendations, collaborative assistant behavior, explainability, and conservative human-in-the-loop controls.
- Critical guardrails: disallow autonomous fixes in security-sensitive or production-critical contexts, avoid opaque/high-confidence hallucinations, and preserve developer learning.
- The primary tension is between efficiency (automate grunt work) and accountability/trust (retain human oversight for complex decisions); design patterns like confidence-weighted suggestions and scoped automation can bridge this gap.
- Recommendation: Build AI debugging features that start narrow and verifiable, emphasize provenance and explainability, and progressively increase autonomy only as confidence and contextual fidelity improve.
