## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: 1. Intelligent Test Creation & Maintenance

Developers want AI to take on the heavy lifting of generating, extending, and maintaining tests across the lifecycle. Under the "Context-aware test generation" code participants imagine AI that can write tests from code, specifications, layouts or natural-language descriptions, extend simple "happy-path" tests with edge cases, and maintain tests over time as code evolves. For example, one participant asked for AI to "Help me designing good and thorough tests" (Participant 18), while others envisioned an AI that can turn a PM's test specification into runnable tests ("More automated tests built by AI that even a PM could specify what they want to test and AI handles it." — Participant 35). Boundaries noted include expectations that AI should be high-context (derive tests from layout and code) and not produce a flood of low-value or redundant tests.

Closely related is "Coverage analysis & gap closure": developers expect AI to analyze test coverage, flag missing cases, and create targeted tests to reduce regression risk. Participants want a shift from reactive firefighting to preventive coverage-driven QA ("I want AI to play a major role in proactively detecting regressions, analyzing test coverage gaps, and predicting high-risk areas..." — Participant 57). They also envision AI that can autonomously implement tests to cover flagged gaps ("To analyse missing test coverage and implement tests on its own" — Participant 408). The desired outcome is higher, more consistent code coverage and fewer regressions, with AI augmenting developer productivity while still fitting into human workflows.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Context-aware test generation**: AI writes tests from code/specs/layouts or NL descriptions, extends happy-path tests with edge cases, and maintains them over time.
- **Coverage analysis & gap closure**: AI analyzes test coverage, flags missing cases, and creates extra tests to reduce regression risk.

Number of participants: ~25 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"More automated tests built by AI that even a PM could specify what they want to test and AI handles it."* (Participant 35)
- *"Over the next 1–3 years, I want AI to play a major role in proactively detecting regressions, analyzing test coverage gaps, and predicting high-risk areas..."* (Participant 57)
- *"Having AI help test the products/features... build unit test to achieve high code coverage."* (Participant 345)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: 2. Early Risk Detection & Quality Gatekeeping

Developers see strong value in AI surfacing risks early and embedding quality checks into CI/CD. Under "Proactive regression & anomaly detection," participants want AI to detect deviations from baselines, predict which code changes are high-risk, and surface anomalies before they escalate. This is framed as moving QA from a reactive stance to one that anticipates failures ("AI shows promise in detecting deviations from a known good baseline... alert us to potential issues while they're still low-sev" — Participant 167). They also expect risk-tracking across projects to highlight root causes rather than repeated symptom-fixing ("track risk trends across projects" — Participant 301).

"CI/CD quality automation" describes AI augmenting pipelines with static analysis, fuzz testing, automated compilation, and other low-cognitive but high-effort checks. Participants want AI to make these processes easier and more reliable so developers can focus on higher-value work ("Automated compilation, testing infra which can be relied on... Easy to use interfaces" — Participant 336). The desired outcome is more consistent, continuous quality assurance integrated within developer workflows.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Proactive regression & anomaly detection**: AI spots deviations from baselines, predicts high-risk areas, and surfaces hidden issues early.
- **CI/CD quality automation**: AI augments pipelines with static analysis, fuzz testing, and other QA automation.

Number of participants: ~10 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"Over the next 1–3 years, I want AI to play a major role in proactively detecting regressions..."* (Participant 57)
- *"If it can scan logs, configs, or workflow patterns and flag things that might break later... that would save me a ton of time."* (Participant 301)
- *"Ideally AI could enhance existing CI/CD processes like static code analysis, fuzz testing..."* (Participant 365)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: 3. Security, Compliance & Adversarial Testing

Participants expect AI to be an adversary and a compliance aide—finding vulnerabilities, checking correctness, and running exploratory or chaos tests that humans might miss. Under "Security, vulnerability & compliance checks," developers want AI to identify security risks, compliance gaps, and correctness problems, sometimes by reading code and acting like a white‑hat attacker ("I want AI to automatically detect security risks and create chaos testing environments" — Participant 46). They value AI assistance for exhaustive test case generation in security contexts and for easing the burden of compliance testing ("Security and Compliance … AI can play a huge role here..." — Participant 299).

"Exploratory, chaos, & adversarial testing" emphasizes autonomous exploration—randomized or adversarial inputs, end-to-end regression runs, and monkey testing that can uncover unimaginable failure modes ("use it as a more advanced form of Monkey Testing." — Participant 17). Participants want AI that can generate scenarios for complete E2E regression testing and act as a creative adversary to surface subtle faults.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Security, vulnerability & compliance checks**: AI finds vulnerabilities, compliance issues, correctness problems, acting like an adversary.
- **Exploratory, chaos, & adversarial testing**: AI conducts autonomous exploratory/chaos testing and end-to-end regression runs.

Number of participants: ~10 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"I want AI to automatically detect security risks and create chaos testing environments..."* (Participant 46)
- *"AI can act as a great adversary."* (Participant 299)
- *"I want the AI agent to explore my product as a user... find bugs before any of our customers find them."* (Participant 117)

Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: 1. Quality & Trust Concerns

Developers voiced concerns that AI-produced outputs can be inaccurate, hallucinated, or unverifiable—introducing risk rather than reducing it. The core worry is that AI can present confident but incorrect results, which is particularly dangerous in automated testing contexts ("AI should absolutely not be the determining factor... it frequently hallucinates with absolute certainty" — Participant 17). Participants reported experiences where AI-generated code required careful manual inspection and where automation slowed processes because of inaccuracies ("AI written code can be really bad... necessary for a dev to test understand what AI wrote." — Participant 51). They also highlighted the verification difficulty for UI automation and KPI handling ("UI automation might be difficult to verify if AI tries to do it and doesn't do it correctly." — Participant 71).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers worry that AI outputs in testing/QA are inaccurate, hallucinated, unverifiable, or introduce risk rather than reducing it.

Number of participants: ~5 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"AI should absolutely not be the determining factor... it frequently hallucinates with absolute certainty..."* (Participant 17)
- *"AI written code can be really bad, its necessary for a dev to test understand what AI wrote."* (Participant 51)
- *"If there is something that it is not capable of doing, abort with that information, rather than making some assumptions..."* (Participant 336)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: 2. Human Oversight & Accountability

Across many responses, developers insisted humans must retain responsibility for testing outcomes; AI must not be allowed to finalize quality or security checks autonomously. Participants want transparency about what the AI did ("what testing did the AI do?", "do we have a report with screenshots... proving that the AI actually did what it claims" — Participant 117). They emphasize that final judgments about release readiness, risk acceptance, or sign-off belong to people who understand business context and accountability ("I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness or risk acceptance" — Participant 241). Participants also expect workflows where AI assists—suggesting or automating tasks—while humans validate and own results ("Ultimately it is a human's decision... AI would be better able to test individual things" — Participant 103).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers emphasize that humans must remain responsible for testing outcomes; AI should not self-evaluate, finalize quality/security checks, or commit code/tests without human review.

Number of participants: ~15 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"I do not want AI to be solely responsible for quality and security; a developer needs to validate the results..."* (Participant 41)
- *"It's fine to delegate many tasks to AI agents... but we always need a person to be accountable for verifying."* (Participant 117)
- *"I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness or risk acceptance..."* (Participant 241)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: 3. Context & Risk-Sensitive Judgment

Developers emphasized that high-stakes decisions require contextual, business, and ethical judgment that AI cannot reliably provide. Several participants explicitly rejected delegating tasks like release triage, compliance acceptance, or requirement definition to AI because AI lacks the situational awareness and business-context reasoning necessary for those calls ("I don’t want AI to make final decisions on critical production rollouts..." — Participant 57). They also noted that AI may not capture complex business requirements and therefore cannot be trusted to verify quality or evaluate risk without human-defined criteria ("You can't reliably depend on an AI system for the verification criteria; a human has to define that" — Participant 165).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers stress that high-stakes decisions (e.g., release readiness, triaging, compliance) require contextual, business, and ethical judgment that AI cannot provide.

Number of participants: ~5 participants

Representative quotes:
- *"I don’t want AI to make final decisions on critical production rollouts..."* (Participant 57)
- *"I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness or risk acceptance..."* (Participant 241)
- *"Deciding what the requirements should be... I want to be the one controlling the criteria we're testing for."* (Participant 165)

Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to automate repetitive, well-structured tasks (test generation, coverage analysis, CI/CD augmentation, adversarial testing) while simultaneously fearing AI hallucinations and unverifiable outputs. This creates a clear complementarity: AI as an efficiency engine for breadth and scale; humans as the validators of depth and context. Many participants asked for AI to do the laborious exploration and test synthesis but also requested strong human checks before acceptance.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance is highly conditional. Developers favor AI that provides verifiable artifacts (test code, logs, screenshots), aborts when uncertain, and integrates into review/CI workflows. They consistently require explainability, audit trails, and the ability to edit or override AI outputs. Where AI produces clear evidence (e.g., generated unit tests with coverage metrics, reproducible failure traces), trust rises; where outputs are opaque or speculative, trust collapses.

- Task-specific nuances: Testing QA is different from other dev tasks because it combines scale (lots of permutations to test), criticality (security/compliance consequences), and the need for verifiable proof of behavior. This makes it suitable for AI-assisted exploration and gap detection, but also raises the bar for correctness and traceability—especially for security and release decisions.

- Trust and control dynamics: Developers favor “AI as assistant” rather than “AI as decider.” They want AI to surface risks and produce artifacts but insist on human ownership for final decisions. Key control mechanisms requested include human-in-the-loop sign-off, confidence thresholds, detailed reports/evidence, and the ability to customize test criteria and acceptance rules.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Contradictory positions within individuals: Some participants appear in both “want” and “don’t want” lists (e.g., Participant 17 advocated for AI-driven monkey testing but also warned about hallucinations). This indicates ambivalence: developers recognize AI's potential but remain cautious about its current limitations.

- Minority calls for stronger autonomy: A few participants pushed for more autonomous agents that can implement tests "on its own" (e.g., Participant 408: "implement tests on its own"). These are minority positions and usually accompanied by strong caveats about trust and verification.

- Ambivalent responses: Several participants want AI to run exploratory or chaos tests but simultaneously demand that AI-generated findings be verifiable and human-reviewed. That combination shows conditional enthusiasm rather than unqualified endorsement.

- Unique insight: The explicit framing of AI as an "adversary" (white-hat role) to uncover security and compliance issues is a concrete, actionable framing that differs from simply asking for more tests. It suggests opportunities for AI to simulate malicious user behavior or unexpected failures in ways humans may not anticipate.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI to increase test breadth, surface hidden risks early, and automate routine QA tasks—but only under strict transparency, verifiability, and human control constraints. Tools that balance autonomous test generation and proactive risk detection with auditability and configurable control will be more acceptable.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Context-aware Test Generation & Maintenance**
  - Capability: Generate tests from code, specs, layouts, or NL descriptions and maintain them as code evolves.
  - Rationale: Developers explicitly asked for AI that can extrapolate tests from artifacts and extend happy-paths with edge cases ("Help me designing good and thorough tests" — Participant 18).

- **Coverage Analysis & Gap Closure**
  - Capability: Analyze coverage, flag missing cases, prioritize high-risk gaps, and suggest or generate targeted tests.
  - Rationale: Participants want to shift from reactive firefighting to preventive QA ("analyzing test coverage gaps..." — Participant 57).

- **Proactive Regression & Anomaly Detection**
  - Capability: Monitor baselines, predict high-risk areas on change, and surface anomalies with contextual explanations.
  - Rationale: Early detection reduces time-to-fix and prevents low-severity issues from escalating ("alert us to potential issues while they're still low-sev" — Participant 167).

- **Security/Adversarial Testing Mode**
  - Capability: Run adversarial/chaos tests and simulate attacker workflows for security/compliance discovery.
  - Rationale: Participants see value in AI acting as a creative adversary to find vulnerabilities ("AI can act as a great adversary." — Participant 299).

- **CI/CD Integration with Evidence Generation**
  - Capability: Integrate into pipelines to run checks (static analysis, fuzzing) and produce verifiable artifacts (logs, screenshots, coverage reports).
  - Rationale: Developers requested pipeline-level augmentation with traceable outputs ("build unit test to achieve high code coverage" — Participant 345).

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous Final Decisions**
  - Risk: Allowing AI to make release readiness or risk-acceptance decisions removes human accountability.
  - Rationale: Multiple participants insisted on human sign-off for release and risk ("I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness..." — Participant 241).

- **Opaque/Unverifiable Outputs**
  - Risk: Outputs that cannot be audited or reproduced (hallucinated findings) will erode trust.
  - Rationale: Participants demanded proof artifacts and abort behaviors when uncertain ("some times it is better AI respond with no data..." — Participant 91).

- **Unlimited Autonomous Commits**
  - Risk: AI committing tests/code without review can introduce regressions or incorrect logic.
  - Rationale: Participants want AI to assist but not to check in changes without human validation ("Actually checking in code or tests." — Participant 189).

- **Replacing Human-defined Criteria**
  - Risk: AI deciding what to test without human-specified acceptance criteria can misalign testing with business goals.
  - Rationale: Participants want control over requirements and verification criteria ("Deciding what the requirements should be... I want to be the one controlling the criteria" — Participant 165).

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop with Evidence Bundles: Require AI to submit test artifacts (test code, execution logs, screenshots, coverage deltas) as a packaged "evidence bundle" for human review before merge. This satisfies automation desires while preserving human accountability.

- Confidence Thresholding and Safe-Abort: AI should emit calibrated confidence scores and, below thresholds, either flag tasks for human attention or abort with an explanation. This mitigates hallucination risks and aligns with requests that AI "abort with that information" when unsure (Participant 336).

- Policy-Driven Test Generation: Allow teams to encode business-specific testing criteria and compliance rules that constrain AI generation, ensuring tests align with organizational risk posture ("You can't reliably depend on an AI system for the verification criteria; a human has to define that." — Participant 165).

- Sandbox Adversarial Mode: Provide a dedicated sandbox for automated chaos/adversarial runs that produce reproducible artifacts and do not affect production. This enables creative exploration while containing risk ("create chaos testing environments" — Participant 46).

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to automate test creation, maintain tests, analyze coverage gaps, and run adversarial/chaos testing to find issues early and at scale.
- Developers do not want AI to make final release, triage, or compliance decisions, nor to commit unverified code or tests autonomously.
- Design implication: prioritize verifiable artifacts (tests, logs, screenshots), CI/CD integration, and explainability over opaque autonomy.
- Design implication: enforce human-in-the-loop workflows with configurable acceptance criteria and confidence thresholds to balance speed and safety.
- Key tension: developers want broad automation for scale but require strict auditability and human ownership for high-stakes judgments.
- Recommendation: build AI QA tools that generate evidence bundles, include policy-driven constraints, and offer sandboxed adversarial testing—so teams gain automation benefits while retaining control and accountability.
