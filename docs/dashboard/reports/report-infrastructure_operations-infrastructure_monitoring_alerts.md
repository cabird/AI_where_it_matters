# Thematic Analysis — Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerts

This analysis synthesizes developer survey responses about where they want — and do not want — AI applied specifically to Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerts. I coded responses for concrete references to monitoring, alerting, observability, incident response, automation, and related infra setup/configuration, then clustered recurring motivations, concerns, and boundary conditions into themes. Participant counts are approximate and rounded to the nearest 5 per instructions; participants frequently mentioned multiple themes so counts overlap.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automating repetitive monitoring, triage, and root-cause analysis  
   - Description: Developers want AI to remove routine toil by automating log queries, anomaly detection, alert triage, and initial root-cause analysis so humans can focus on higher‑value tasks. The context is day‑to‑day monitoring and incident diagnosis: teams expect AI to surface interesting signals from metrics and logs, highlight anomalies on dashboards, suggest likely causes, and reduce manual chasing across data sources. Desired outcomes are faster time‑to‑detect and time‑to‑diagnose, fewer on‑call hours, and fewer repetitive escalations; acceptable use is narrowly scoped automation for well‑understood, repeatable problems and suggestions rather than opaque, unsupervised actions. Several respondents explicitly framed this as freeing engineers from toil (rebuilding environments, automating boring tasks) and enabling proactive remediation or self‑healing when confidence is high.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"reduction on toil hours spent for monitoring/alerting."* (Participant 2)  
     - *"automate root cause analysis and anomaly detection across our infrastructure"* (Participant 355)  
     - *"Automating queries in logs, making alarms smarter, reducing manual intervention by getting to root cause faster"* (Participant 80)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Incident response augmentation, triage, and enrichment (reducing on‑call burden)  
   - Description: Many developers requested AI to improve incident handling workflows—enrich alerts, assemble context from multiple systems, populate incident templates, and perform structured triage so humans can respond faster or avoid being woken for low‑value alerts. The motivation is both efficiency (faster context collation) and quality (more consistent initial handling). Desired outcomes include auto‑populated incident records, prioritized related incidents, suggested remediation steps, and possible automated remediation for safe, known patterns. Conditions repeatedly mentioned: humans should retain oversight for uncertain or novel incidents, and AI actions should be reviewable and reversible.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call"* (Participant 14)  
     - *"Handling incident response and enrichment better"* (Participant 90)  
     - *"set up templates for created IcMs."* (Participant 200)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Observability analysis and predictive monitoring (anomaly detection & failure prediction)  
   - Description: Participants want AI to continuously analyze logs, traces, and metrics to surface anomalies, predict failures, and highlight health/security issues that humans might miss. The context is proactive monitoring: using pattern recognition to catch incipient problems, surface cross‑service health indicators, and recommend where to focus engineering effort. The motivation is risk reduction and earlier detection; expected outcomes include fewer unplanned outages and better prioritization of reliability work. Conditions include a need for explainability and accuracy before trusting predictive suggestions for action.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"identify deviations and predict potential failures before they impact operations"* (Participant 309)  
     - *"analysis of metrics and logs to accelerate root cause analysis of incidents, highlighting interesting things in dashboards, and discovering anomalies"* (Participant 54)  
     - *"Detect anomalies, predict failures"* (Participant 195)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Setup, configuration and continuous maintenance of monitors/alerts (including reading infra code)  
   - Description: Several responses asked for AI to generate, tune, and maintain monitors and alerts—ideally by understanding infrastructure code and topology (e.g., IaC) to auto‑provision sensible alerts and keep them in sync as systems evolve. Motivation is to avoid manual, error-prone alert configuration and to create a cohesive, less‑fragmented monitoring experience across CI/CD and infra changes. Desired outcomes include fewer missing or noisy alerts and automated drift correction; boundaries include restricting autonomous production changes unless validated by engineers.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Custom monitoring and alerts without having to think about it... For copilot to read our ev2 and know how our infra is setup would be insane."* (Participant 123)  
     - *"Managing both CI/CD and Alerts and monitors setup"* (Participant 333)  
     - *"We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work."* (Participant 269)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 5. Theme: Human augmentation, explainability and learning support  
   - Description: Developers want AI to augment engineers’ capabilities and accelerate learning rather than replace the cognitive work of building intuition about unique environments. The context is training and knowledge transfer during monitoring and incident work: AI should explain its reasoning, suggest learning paths, and enhance engineers’ understanding of why an alert fired. Motivation includes preserving career development, improving junior engineer ramp‑up, and ensuring humans can handle novel failures. Desired outcomes are transparent suggestions, educational guidance, and tools that scaffold — not supplant — human judgment. Several participants explicitly asked for AI to be a teaching tool and to avoid stunting skill growth.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should guide and assist human engineer development, not replace lower experience engineers..."* (Participant 16)  
     - *"The human should always be paramount, and AI should be a tool to enhance what humans can understand"* (Participant 16)  
     - *"AI should help me understand the live incident, and give me some suggestions"* (Participant 246)  
   - Confidence: Medium–High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Autonomous critical actions, emergency overrides, and high‑stakes decisions  
   - Description: A dominant concern is that AI should not autonomously take critical actions that could cause downtime or safety incidents; emergency response decisions and system overrides must remain under human control. The context is high‑impact operational decisions during incidents—participants fear that unsupervised AI could misinterpret context, cascade failures, or remove human accountability. The feared outcome is significant outages or unrecoverable states if AI acts incorrectly. The boundary is clear: suggestions and automations are fine when humans approve, but autonomous intervention for critical actions is unacceptable.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"For critical actions, I would not like AI to take actions on it's own."* (Participant 271)  
     - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle emergency response decisions or critical system overrides..."* (Participant 331)  
     - *"Anything regarding permissions to developers and customers should be off-limit for AI."* (Participant 371)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: No direct production writes or touching sensitive/critical infra (security, secrets, access control)  
   - Description: Several developers explicitly opposed allowing AI to perform direct writes to production or manage sensitive resources such as secrets, key vaults, permissions, and security configurations. The concern is that mistakes or leakage could create security risks or outages; the feared outcome is unauthorized changes or compromised secrets. Participants set firm boundaries: AI may suggest changes but must not have unsupervised access to make critical modifications.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Probably direct touches to production systems"* (Participant 123)  
     - *"Secret/keyvault management"* (Participant 234)  
     - *"I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls"* (Participant 284)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Complex reasoning and live-site decision‑making should remain human‑led  
   - Description: Participants worry that AI cannot reliably navigate complex, evolving live‑site contexts which require cross‑source reasoning, prioritization, and situational judgement. The concern is that handed‑off autonomy would fail in novel or nuanced incidents and that AI's reasoning might be brittle. The feared outcome is incorrect remediation paths or misprioritized actions during high‑complexity incidents. The boundary is to restrict AI to assistance (context aggregation, suggested next steps) rather than end‑to‑end decisions in complex workflows.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Reasoning and decision making while navigating through a complex workflow ... analyzing a livesite and root causing while referring multiple sources of information."* (Participant 29)  
     - *"Engineers still need to learn how things work... every environment is so different..."* (Participant 16)  
     - *"Final checks might need to be more brute force... to make sure that AI doesn't do mistakes."* (Participant 262)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Preference for precise, deterministic automation over ML where precision is required  
   - Description: Some developers argued AI/ML should not replace traditional deterministic automation in contexts demanding exactness—where algorithms or programmatic checks give guaranteed correctness. The concern is ML’s probabilistic nature causing unacceptable errors in precise operations (for example, deployment gating or safety‑critical checks). The feared outcome is regressions or incorrect actions because of ML uncertainty; the boundary is to prefer code‑based automation for such tasks and to use ML only where deterministic solutions aren’t feasible.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"For operations that needs to be precise, it is better to automate using traditional programming."* (Participant 195)  
     - *"ML is not perfect; it is best used where algorithms are not available/feasible to implement."* (Participant 195)  
     - *"Any activity which cannot be fully and reliably handled by AI should not be done by AI."* (Participant 44)  
   - Confidence: Medium–High

#### 5. Theme: Concerns about skill erosion and organizational overreliance on AI  
   - Description: A subset of responses voiced cultural and career concerns—if AI handles too much of monitoring and incident work, junior engineers may not learn the intuition needed for complex operational troubleshooting. The feared outcome is stunted engineer development and organizational dependency on brittle tools. The boundary is to use AI as a teaching and assistive tool, not as a replacement for on‑the‑job learning opportunities.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should guide and assist human engineer development, not replace lower experience engineers..."* (Participant 16)  
     - *"Managers are happy to fire an employee that doesn't learn from their mistakes, but everybody seems happy to keep pushing AI despite the same failures."* (Participant 145)  
     - *"I want AI to enhance human engineer's ability WHILE increasing the rate at which human engineers learn and develop."* (Participant 16)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- There is strong alignment on automating repetitive, detectable monitoring tasks (anomaly detection, triage, RCA) while preserving human control for high‑risk or novel situations; many participants occupy both camps (want AI for speed and scale, but not for autonomous critical decisions).
- Tension exists between desire for full automation (some asked for AI to "handle infra setup and maintenance") and the consistent boundary against unsupervised production changes. Even participants who want broad automation frequently require human confirm/override for high‑impact actions.
- Developers consistently require explainability, confidence thresholds, and a human‑in‑the‑loop workflow: AI can suggest and assemble context, but final remediation, emergency overrides, secrets, and permission changes should be gated or restricted.
- Conditions repeatedly requested: audit logs, reversible actions, clear confidence/uncertainty signals, and alignment with deterministic programmatic checks for safety‑critical tasks.
- Relation to other tasks: Several participants explicitly contrasted AI use in monitoring with CI/CD, environment setup, and security (e.g., using AI to configure CI/CD and alerting but not to replace deterministic deployment safeguards). Some asked for an integrated AI experience spanning infra setup, CI/CD, and monitoring to avoid repeated, fragmented tool use.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- A few participants expressed maximal trust or enthusiasm: "Let it do everything" (Participant 54) and requests that AI fully handle infra (Participants 168, 114 reported no limits). These stand apart from the dominant cautious stance.
- Some responses were internally contradictory: a participant both asked for AI to do all infra setup and also listed "setup, maintenance and alerts" under where AI is not wanted (Participant 219), indicating ambiguity about whether they meant to exclude ML specifically or automation generally.
- Unique ideas: "Infrastructure as prompts" (Participant 371) and AI reading infrastructure code to infer monitoring needs (Participant 123) suggest novel design directions (declarative infra descriptions consumed by AI).
- Strong single‑topic emphases: Participant 109 repeated "SFI" emphatically—indicating a specific operational capability (site fault isolation or similar) that is a high priority for some teams.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI that reliably reduces toil and improves detection while preserving human judgment and the safety of production systems. Tools must be designed for assistive automation with explicit guardrails, transparency, and integration into existing incident workflows.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Action suggestions with human approval (Human‑in‑the‑loop)
  - Provide recommended remediation steps, runbooks, or playbooks as actions that require explicit engineer confirmation before executing changes.
- Explainability and confidence scoring
  - Show why an alert was flagged, what signals were used, and a calibrated confidence level to help engineers trust or challenge AI suggestions.
- Read‑only context aggregation and incident enrichment
  - Automatically collect logs, traces, recent deploys, and relevant configs into a single view and populate incident templates (no automatic writes by default).
- Safe sandboxed automation and reversible playbooks
  - Allow automated remediation in pre‑approved, tested playbooks with rollbacks and audit trails; restrict novel actions to dry‑run mode.
- Integration with infra code and CI/CD pipelines
  - Use IaC and deployment metadata to generate and maintain monitors, reduce drift, and suggest alert tuning aligned with deployments.
- Fine‑grained permissions & secret handling rules
  - Never allow AI to access or modify secrets/key vaults without human oversight; enforce policy checks and audit logging.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous execution of critical system overrides or emergency decisions without human authorization.
- Unsupervised writes to production or direct modification of permissions, security configs, or secrets.
- Using opaque ML outputs as sole basis for production‑critical gating (prefer deterministic checks or human approval).
- Removing learning opportunities: do not hide diagnostics; ensure AI explanations include learning content and links to runbooks.

(Design pattern to resolve tensions: adopt "suggest, simulate, approve" — AI proposes suggestions, runs simulations/dry‑runs in sandbox, and requires human approval for production changes above a configurable impact threshold.)

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive monitoring tasks: anomaly detection, log queries, alert triage, and faster root‑cause analysis.
- There is strong demand for AI to enrich incidents (context aggregation and templates) and reduce on‑call burden, provided humans retain final control.
- Predictive monitoring and observability analysis are desired, but only with explainability and confidence indicators before acting automatically.
- Major limits: no unsupervised critical actions, no autonomous production writes, and no handling of secrets/permissions without human oversight.
- Teams prefer deterministic programmatic automation for precision‑critical operations and want AI to augment learning rather than replace human skill acquisition.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize AI features that aggregate context, surface anomalies, and suggest RCA steps while keeping humans in control of actions.  
- Implement clear human‑in‑the‑loop flows with confidence scores, dry‑runs, and explicit approval gates for any production changes.  
- Restrict AI access to secrets, permissions, and critical config changes; require policy enforcement and auditing for any sensitive operation.  
- Provide explainable outputs and teachable explanations to help junior engineers learn from AI suggestions.  
- Favor deterministic automation for high‑precision checks and use ML where deterministic solutions aren’t feasible; document the boundary clearly.
