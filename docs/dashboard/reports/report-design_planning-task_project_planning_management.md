# Thematic Analysis — Task/Project Planning & Management

I reviewed each participant response and focused only on comments directly about Task/Project Planning & Management. I coded recurring topics, grouped them into coherent themes where participants described specific planning/management activities (e.g., creating work items, scheduling, estimation, monitoring, cross‑team coordination), and synthesized motivations, desired outcomes, and explicit boundaries mentioned by respondents.

---

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automating routine administrative and status work  
   - Description: Many developers want AI to take over repetitive, low‑value planning chores — drafting documentation, writing progress reports and summaries, taking notes, scheduling meetings, generating structured status reports, and handling ADO/issue bookkeeping. The context is everyday project maintenance and reporting that consumes time but adds limited strategic value. Motivation is primarily to reduce toil and free engineers to focus on design and collaboration; the desired outcome is fewer manual updates and more accurate, consistently formatted artifacts. Participants typically set the boundary that this work should be reliably accurate, integrated with their tooling (e.g., ADO), and reversible or reviewable by humans.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Plan and keep track of schedules"* (Participant 14)  
     - *"I want AI to cover trivial and repetitive work (creating documents, slides, ....) so that I can focus on what really matters."* (Participant 72)  
     - *"If it could automatically keep track of all the mundane stuff like notes and scheduling so we can write less."* (Participant 186)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Generating and decomposing work items, plans, and ADO integration  
   - Description: A strong group of participants want AI to convert specs, designs, or high‑level goals into concrete project artifacts — breaking epics into stories, creating tasks and bugs, populating ADO items, proposing realistic timelines, milestones, and iteration planning. Contexts include initial project setup, sprint planning, and backlog grooming. Motivation is efficiency and consistent task structure; desired outcome is faster, more systematic task breakdown and better alignment between design and execution. Common boundaries are that AI should create drafts that are easily editable, require human approval for final assignment/prioritization, and integrate with existing project tools.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Full project planning with timelines & agile tickets"* (Participant 7)  
     - *"Being able to accurately turn a design + architecture into a project plan, with realistic timelines, and milestones."* (Participant 27)  
     - *"I'd like for AI to control my ADO workitems, tasks and bugs."* (Participant 93)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Estimation, scenario simulation, resource optimization, and risk forecasting  
   - Description: Participants want AI to support estimation and decision‑support by modeling scenarios, forecasting outcomes, detecting risks, and optimizing resource allocation and schedules. The context is early planning and trade‑off evaluation where uncertainty exists; motivation is to surface risks earlier, reduce guesswork, and produce data‑driven timelines or staffing plans. Desired outcomes include better estimates, risk‑aware plans, and workload distribution that reduces burnout. Boundaries include requiring provenance for forecasts, the ability for humans to override or interrogate assumptions, and cautious use in high‑stakes decisions.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Iâ€™d like AI to play a key role in scenario simulation, effort estimation, and design validation during the planning phase."* (Participant 9)  
     - *"Over the next 1â€“3 years, I want AI to play a bigger role in real-time risk detection and predictive analytics."* (Participant 331)  
     - *"Project planning based on the available resources... assign tasks to them... with least burnout to the engineers."* (Participant 299)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Design and architecture planning assistance (alternatives, trade‑offs, reviews)  
   - Description: Many developers want AI as a collaborator in architecture and design planning: suggesting alternative architectures, surfacing edge cases, analyzing historical bottlenecks, and laying out trade‑offs with rationale. The context is design discussions and technical planning sessions; motivation is to accelerate ideation, avoid repeating past mistakes, and make trade‑offs more explicit. Desired outcome is higher‑quality design options and faster convergence in discussions. Boundaries include keeping final creative/strategic decisions human‑led and ensuring AI provides clear reasoning and references.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Exploring optimal architectural patterns, analyzing historical system bottlenecks, and generating risk aware design proposals"* (Participant 57)  
     - *"AI to assist with exploring design alternatives, identifying edge cases, and helping align architecture with evolving business goals."* (Participant 241)  
     - *"help me during design discussions by laying out the pros and cons of each option weâ€™re considering."* (Participant 301)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 5. Theme: Cross‑tool and contextual aggregation (collating conversations, telemetry, historical context)  
   - Description: Several participants want AI to gather and synthesize context from multiple sources — emails, chat, telemetry, repo commits, and docs — to provide a single, searchable context that informs planning. The context is fragmented project knowledge that makes accurate planning hard; motivation is to reduce time spent hunting for historical decisions and to ground planning in reality. Desired outcome is faster, better‑informed scoping and automated context retrieval; boundaries include privacy, access permissions, and the need for accurate citations/provenance.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"integrating across platforms to gather information for design and POC"* (Participant 25)  
     - *"I have thousands of emails and teams conversations... impossible to aggregate into a summary and reference"* (Participant 183)  
     - *"Assist in collating information across external and internal sources."* (Participant 175)  
   - Confidence: Medium–High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Final decisions, strategic vision, and prioritization should remain human  
   - Description: A dominant concern is that AI should not be entrusted with final decision‑making, setting product vision, or making strategic trade‑offs. Contexts flagged include prioritization, product taste, stakeholder alignment, and high‑stakes trade‑offs where human judgment, accountability, and long‑term business context matter. Concerns are about loss of human ownership, misaligned priorities, and lack of empathy or accountability in AI choices. The feared outcome is derailment of projects by decisions that look plausible but lack necessary context. Participants often allow AI to provide options, analyses, or suggestions but require human sign‑off and final authority.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to handle 'interpretation'... avoid making decisions of 'taste'."* (Participant 3)  
     - *"Making decisions... the end decision and plan should be my responsibility"* (Participant 10)  
     - *"I donâ€™t want AI to independently drive product vision or make strategic trade-off decisions."* (Participant 57)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Running teams, task assignment, and cross‑team coordination should stay human‑led  
   - Description: Many respondents explicitly rejected AI operating Agile teams, autonomously assigning or coordinating tasks across people, or acting as a team manager. The context includes handling sudden day‑to‑day changes, interpersonal dynamics, and knowing individual strengths; concerns center on AI's inability to handle human nuances and adapt to ad‑hoc changes. The feared outcome is poor task assignments, reduced team agency, and brittle responses to real‑world variability. Participants said AI may assist (suggest lists, surface dependencies) but not replace human coordination.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to 'operate' my Agile team."* (Participant 39)  
     - *"Task/Project Planning. Because my co-workers are not AI. There are so many sudden changes in daily life."* (Participant 46)  
     - *"I do not want AI to support the Task Planning and/or Management because it does not understand the strengths of individuals."* (Participant 140)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Lack of trust, accuracy, grounding, and up‑to‑date information limits adoption  
   - Description: A widespread barrier is AI unreliability — hallucinations, inaccurate outputs, missing grounding data, and stale knowledge. Contexts include estimation, planning suggestions, and auto‑generated tasks where errors are costly. Concerns are that AI will produce plausible but wrong artifacts, increasing rather than decreasing work. The feared outcome is wasted effort, incorrect plans, or missed constraints; participants requested provenance, links, higher accuracy, and human verification. Many argued AI should flag uncertainty and ask for clarification before acting.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"In my specific role... results are too inaccurate and untrustworthy, or it doesn't have access to the right grounding data."* (Participant 53)  
     - *"Reducing hallucinations. That's my only complaint with AI today."* (Participant 98)  
     - *"At this point I cannot trust AI to make important decisions."* (Participant 66)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Sensitive information and confidentiality constraints  
   - Description: Several participants said AI should not be used for planning activities that expose confidential product thinking, IP, or sensitive data unless strict protections exist. The context is early product ideation and detailed product thinking where leaks could cause harm. Concerns center on privacy, data handling, and accidental exposure. The boundary is clear: sensitive planning material requires strict governance before AI involvement.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"something related to detailed product thinking, afraid the idea would be exposed"* (Participant 251)  
     - *"Anything with sensitive data"* (Participant 266)  
     - *"I don't know, maybe something related to confidential informations."* (Participant 253)  
   - Confidence: Medium–Low

#### 5. Theme: Preserving human learning, agency, and avoiding job displacement  
   - Description: A subset of respondents worry that AI will erode engineers' learning opportunities (by doing tasks that teach skills) or threaten jobs. Contexts include replacing tasks that foster skill growth (like understanding codebases or planning), or automated decisions removing human agency. The feared outcomes are reduced developer expertise, loss of accountability, and potential layoffs. Participants therefore preferred AI that augments learning and explicitly leaves final control with people.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should enhance an engineer's learning and development, not replace work that fosters that development."* (Participant 16)  
     - *"I don't want AI to replace me and get me laid off."* (Participant 386)  
     - *"I like the feeling of agency when driving my work in collaboration with my colleagues."* (Participant 39)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections: The most consistent pattern is a desire for AI to reduce repetitive manual work (notes, docs, task creation) and to surface data‑driven analyses (estimates, risks, alternatives) while leaving core human responsibilities — final decisions, team management, stakeholder alignment — to people. Many participants framed AI as a “drafting” or “assistant” capability rather than an autonomous actor.

- Tensions: There is a clear tension between those who want AI to autonomously manage planning end‑to‑end (a few participants) and the larger group that requires human oversight for decisions and team dynamics. Another tension is between wanting automatic prioritization/assignment vs. distrust of AI’s contextual awareness — some asked for automatic prioritization (e.g., Participant 151) while others strongly rejected that idea (e.g., Participant 109).

- Conditions and boundaries: Recurrent conditions include: (1) human‑in‑the‑loop approval for final plans, (2) transparent reasoning and provenance for any estimates or trade‑offs, (3) ability to query and correct AI output, (4) strict handling of sensitive data, and (5) integration with existing tooling (ADO, telemetry, chat/email), plus the AI should escalate or ask for missing info before acting.

### Relation to other tasks
- Several participants contrasted planning with other activities: requirements gathering and stakeholder empathy were repeatedly identified as tasks where humans should lead (e.g., Participants 330, 393). Participants anticipated AI being more reliable for mechanical tasks (doc writing, decomposition) than for eliciting ambiguous human requirements.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full automation advocates: A few participants want near‑complete automation of planning and management (e.g., Participant 163: "Planning and management... outsourced to a machine"), representing an extreme that most did not share.

- Total rejection: Some respondents currently distrust AI so strongly that they prefer no involvement until substantial accuracy improvements (e.g., Participant 357).

- Conflicting positions within respondents: A few entries show mixed attitudes (e.g., wanting AI to create tasks but not to manage them), highlighting a nuanced "assist but not replace" stance.

- Unique wants: A few asked for specialized capabilities: precise ADO natural language queries and actions (Participant 205), voice‑based design copilots that participate in meetings (Participant 318), and AI that links planning to live telemetry/DevOps signals (Participant 183).

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Overall takeaway: Developers want AI that reduces planning toil and improves insight while preserving human control, accountability, and learning. Tools must be accurate, transparent, integrated, and permissioned.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Seamless tool integration (ADO, issue trackers, calendar, chat, repo/telemetry)  
  - Capability: Read/write access to create/update tasks, move items across sprints, and fetch context from messages and commits. Rationale: many users explicitly want ADO automation and consolidated context.
- Human‑in‑the‑loop controls and approval workflows  
  - Capability: Suggest/draft mode by default, explicit approve/accept actions, and role‑based permission levels. Rationale: preserves agency and prevents inadvertent autonomous changes.
- Explainability, provenance, and confidence indicators  
  - Capability: For each estimate, task break‑down, or design suggestion include rationale, data sources, and a confidence score with links. Rationale: reduces hallucination risk and supports verification.
- Robust estimation and scenario‑modeling engines with editability  
  - Capability: Parameterized scenario simulations, resource optimization, and alternative schedules that users can tweak. Rationale: supports data‑driven planning and addresses desire for risk forecasting.
- Privacy, access controls, and sensitive data handling  
  - Capability: Data governance settings, masking, and explicit consent flows for using private artifacts in model prompts. Rationale: reduces risk around confidential planning.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous final decisioning or automated cross‑team reassignments without explicit human sign‑off  
  - Rationale: broad developer rejection of AI owning prioritization, vision, or team operations.
- Silent edits or automatic changes to project state without audit trail  
  - Rationale: users want transparency and ability to revert; silent changes harm trust.
- Presenting suggestions without provenance or with overstated confidence  
  - Rationale: hallucinations and inaccurate proposals were recurring concerns.

Design patterns to resolve tensions
- Default to "Draft & Suggest" UI: AI produces editable artifacts with clear action buttons (Suggest / Ask for clarification / Apply draft) and an audit log.  
- Confidence thresholds + escalation: when confidence is low or ambiguous, AI must ask clarifying questions instead of acting.  
- Role‑aware automation: permit managers to enable more powerful automation while defaulting to conservative modes for individual contributors.

## Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize automating repetitive planning chores (docs, notes, scheduling, ADO updates) while keeping humans in control of approvals.  
- Build trustworthy estimation and scenario tools with clear provenance and editable assumptions.  
- Integrate deeply with existing tooling (issue trackers, email/chat, telemetry) so AI suggestions are grounded in project context.  
- Default to suggestion/draft modes and require explicit human sign‑off for changes that affect timelines, priorities, or assignments.  
- Enforce privacy and access controls for sensitive planning data and expose audit trails for any AI‑driven project changes.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to remove mundane planning tasks (scheduling, notes, docs, ADO updates) to free time for higher‑value work.  
- Many welcome AI that decomposes specs into tasks, proposes realistic timelines, and generates draft work items, but expect editable drafts and human approval.  
- Estimation, scenario modeling, and risk forecasting are high‑value AI opportunities if the system provides transparent assumptions and provenance.  
- Strong resistance exists to AI making final decisions, running teams, or autonomously reassigning work — human oversight is essential.  
- Trust and accuracy (reducing hallucinations) and integration with existing tools are critical prerequisites for broad adoption.
