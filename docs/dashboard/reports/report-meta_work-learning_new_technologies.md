# Thematic Analysis — Learning New Technologies

I reviewed each participant’s statements and extracted only the portions that explicitly referred to learning new technologies. I grouped related ideas into themes about where developers want AI help and where they prefer AI not be used, noting motivations, expected outcomes, and the limits participants placed on AI. Participant counts are approximate and rounded to the nearest five as requested.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Personalized onboarding, learning plans and curated resources  
   - Description: Many developers want AI to act like a personalized learning coach that assembles and curates the right resources for them—creating onboarding guides, study plans, progress reports, and notifications about relevant new technologies. The motivation is efficiency and reduced discovery toil: participants expect AI to surface relevant content, tailor paths to their existing knowledge, and summarize what’s new so they can focus time on practicing. They set boundaries around quality and provenance (references, summaries, draft notifications for review) and expect AI to produce drafts or plans that they still review and act on.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Helping me gather the resources to learn more effectively on the job."* (Participant 25)  
     - *"Notify me when a new technology related with my daily work or my interests comes out (with a brief summary with references)."* (Participant 72)  
     - *"It has the ability to create learning plans which are very helpful."* (Participant 269)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Step‑by‑step tutorials, exercises and interactive walkthroughs  
   - Description: Developers want AI to provide concrete, actionable learning artifacts—tutorial walkthroughs, exercises, worked examples, and code snippets that build concepts from the ground up. The context is explicit skill acquisition (e.g., learning a language or framework); the motivation is faster, scaffolded learning that adapts to the learner’s pace. Desired outcomes include practical, exercise-driven learning rather than only high-level descriptions. Boundaries include a preference for AI that facilitates practice (scaffolded exercises) rather than doing tasks entirely for the learner.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Exercises to learn new coding languages and tech within AI agents instead of reading books or online tutorials."* (Participant 71)  
     - *"Walk me through tutorials, providing helpful examples, or pointing me toward a path of learning."* (Participant 169)  
     - *"One prompt should give me a response that builds my concepts from ground up. More like a personal course..."* (Participant 281)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Fast research, summaries, and context‑aware explanations to accelerate learning  
   - Description: Several participants want AI to perform rapid research about new technologies, produce concise, contextual summaries, and explain concepts at an appropriate level. Motivation centers on saving time and lowering the barrier to understand unfamiliar domains; expected outcomes are short, vetted explanations and pointers that respect the user’s existing knowledge. Conditions include needs for accuracy, citations, and context-awareness so recommendations are trustworthy and relevant.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Research, brainstorming, new technologies and documentation."* (Participant 392)  
     - *"I would like AI to notify me when a new technology ... comes out (with a brief summary with references)."* (Participant 72)  
     - *"Research and learning. I want it take into account my own knowledge and experience to provide study materials."* (Participant 280)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Low‑risk Q&A and private mentoring for specific questions  
   - Description: A subset of developers emphasized wanting AI as a safe, nonjudgmental expert to ask very specific or embarrassing questions while learning new technologies. The motivation is psychological safety and speedy answers to targeted doubts; the desired outcome is precise, expert-level replies that accelerate understanding. Boundaries include expecting accuracy and that AI responses supplement—not replace—hands‑on practice.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Being able to ask a specific question about a new technology without self-concern ... is transformative in the learning process."* (Participant 122)  
     - *"Give me more correct information which I don't and want know."* (Participant 325)  
   - Confidence: Medium


---

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Distrust because of accuracy, currency and hallucination risks  
   - Description: Many developers worry AI cannot be trusted to provide correct, current, and verifiable information about new technologies. The context is early or rapidly evolving tools where training data may be stale; the concern is that incorrect guidance would mislead learners. The feared outcome is wasted time, wrong design choices, or learning incorrect practices. Conditions participants require to accept AI in this space include provenance, citations, and explicit statements of confidence or uncertainty.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI will not be helpful because it's hard to verify the accuracy of the information provided without having pre-existing knowledge on the topic."* (Participant 28)  
     - *"Research and Learning new technologies requires nuanced knowledge and AI is not reliable in providing up to date information..."* (Participant 44)  
     - *"I can't really use it for learning because I can't trust it."* (Participant 220)  
   - Confidence: Medium

#### 2. Theme: Do not let AI replace hands‑on learning — learning-by-doing should remain human  
   - Description: Several participants explicitly object to AI replacing the practical, hands-on aspects of learning new technologies because doing the work is essential to internalize skills. The concern is loss of genuine competence and missed learning opportunities if AI performs the tasks for you. The feared outcome is developers who appear to "know" a technology but lack practical ability; many accept AI as a helper (summaries, scaffolding) but not as a substitute for active practice.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to replace the hands-on part of learning new technologies. Just like reading isn't a substitute for trying something."* (Participant 39)  
     - *"It is not so great at actually learning new techs as it does the work for you and you miss a chance to learn by doing."* (Participant 66)  
     - *"Learning - it needs to be me that learns."* (Participant 198)  
   - Confidence: Medium

#### 3. Theme: Preference for human verification and ownership of tech adoption decisions  
   - Description: Some developers want to retain responsibility for evaluating whether a new technology is suitable for their use cases; they worry AI might advocate choices without context or accountability. The concern is that blindly following AI recommendations could lead to poor tool selection or improper application. The boundary is clear: AI can surface options and evidence, but final judgment and verification must remain human.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I would like to handle learning new technologies myself, so that I can verify that we are using them correctly, and if they are actually suitable for our own use cases."* (Participant 271)  
     - *"It can't handle learning new technologies, and I think it would struggle with new technologies without good training data."* (Participant 193)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connection between wants and don't wants: Participants consistently want AI to reduce the discovery and scaffolding burden (curated resources, learning plans, contextual summaries, interactive exercises) while explicitly resisting any role that would replace hands‑on practice or human judgment. In other words, they want AI to prepare and guide, not to do the core learning for them.
- Tensions/contradictions: A recurring tension is between convenience and competence—developers welcome AI that speeds understanding but fear it will create superficial knowledge if allowed to perform tasks that learners should practice. Some participants expressed both enthusiasm for AI-generated learning plans and skepticism about AI’s factual reliability, creating conditional acceptance (AI is useful only if accurate, cited, and human‑reviewed).
- Conditions/boundaries: Common constraints are (1) provenance and citations for facts and recommendations, (2) clear signal of confidence/uncertainty, (3) tools that adapt to existing knowledge, and (4) mechanisms that require learners to engage in hands‑on activities (exercises, challenges) rather than passively consuming answers.

### Relation to other tasks
- Several participants contrasted learning new technologies with adjacent tasks like documentation and research: they are more comfortable letting AI support documentation and research (summarization, draft generation) but are more cautious about AI taking on learning activities that replace active practice. This contrast was explicitly made by participants who listed both documentation/research and learning but signaled different trust levels for each.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- All‑in acceptance: A few participants (e.g., Participant 7 and Participant 23) wrote “All aspects!” or “Everything,” indicating willingness to delegate broad parts of learning to AI—an outlier relative to the more conditional, cautious majority.
- Exercise‑forward proponents: Participant 71 and some others want AI-driven interactive exercises and simulated agents to replace tutorials—this conflicts with hands‑on concerns but suggests a path where AI provides active practice environments rather than passive answers.
- Mixed responses: Several participants left only "WHERE THEY DON'T WANT AI" or vice versa, and a handful provided contradictory lines (e.g., asking for AI help while also saying learning should be human). These reflect nuanced positions rather than simple for/against attitudes.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Designers should treat AI as an assistant that expedites discovery and structures practice while preserving human responsibility for mastery and adoption decisions.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Personalized learning plan generator
  - Capability: Create stepwise onboarding plans and exercises tailored to a user’s prior knowledge and role; include milestones and suggested hands‑on tasks so learners practice, not just read.
  - Rationale: Developers want scaffolded, actionable paths that reduce time-to-competence while maintaining hands‑on practice.
- Provenance, confidence scores and citations
  - Capability: Attach sources, timestamps, and confidence indicators to factual claims and recommendations; highlight when knowledge is based on dated or sparse data.
  - Rationale: Many participants cited trust and currency as primary concerns.
- Interactive practice environments and checks
  - Capability: Offer small interactive exercises, auto‑graded quizzes, or guided code challenges that require the learner to do the work and provide feedback rather than showing full solutions.
  - Rationale: Prevents AI from doing the learner’s work and preserves learning-by-doing.
- Context awareness and user model
  - Capability: Understand the user's current skill level, prior interactions, and job context to tailor explanations and avoid redundant or trivial content.
  - Rationale: Participants requested content that “takes into account my own knowledge.”
- Human‑in‑the‑loop controls
  - Capability: Default to draft mode for plans/summaries, require user review/acceptance for recommendations, and enable easy inspection and override.
  - Rationale: Maintains human ownership of learning and tool-selection decisions.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Do not auto-complete or fully solve practice tasks for learners
  - Rationale: Doing so undermines genuine skill acquisition.
- Do not present produced content without provenance or uncertainty signals
  - Rationale: Unlabeled outputs increase risk of misinformation for new/fast-changing tech.
- Do not make adoption decisions or procurement recommendations without explicit context and human sign-off
  - Rationale: Developers want to retain responsibility for evaluating suitability.

Optional design pattern to resolve tensions: Offer two modes—"Guide mode" (scaffolded exercises, hints, progressive disclosure) and "Answer mode" (full solutions with citations). Default to Guide mode for learning workflows and require explicit user choice to reveal full solutions.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for discovering resources, creating personalized learning plans, and producing concise, contextual summaries about new technologies.
- They strongly prefer AI to scaffold and enable hands‑on practice (exercises, stepwise tutorials) rather than to perform practical tasks on their behalf.
- Trust concerns—accuracy, currency, and hallucinations—are a major barrier to using AI as a primary learning source; provenance and confidence indicators are essential.
- Designers should prioritize personalized, interactive learning tools with human‑in‑the‑loop controls and clear citations; avoid features that let AI substitute for learning-by-doing.
- Provide explicit modes that encourage active practice (hints and exercises) and reserve full solutions behind user intent and review.

---

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Build AI features that assemble curated resources and generate personalized onboarding plans, but require human review.
- Emphasize interactive exercises and progressive hints so learners practice rather than passively consume answers.
- Always surface sources, timestamps, and confidence levels for explanations about new technologies.
- Default to scaffolding and draft outputs; require explicit user action to reveal full solutions or accept tool-selection recommendations.
- Preserve human ownership of final judgments about adopting and using new technologies; use AI to inform decisions, not make them.
