## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Rote Task Automation in Communication
Participants commonly want AI to take over repetitive, low-value communication chores so they can focus on higher-value work. The research description—“AI is expected to take over repetitive, low-value communication chores: scheduling meetings, generating reports, taking notes, sending routine updates, drafting boilerplate docs/emails”—captures the motivation: reduce cognitive load and free human time. Respondents explicitly asked for scheduling support (“Meeting scheduling. Here is a list of names put a meeting on the calendar with a room and Teams link.” (Participant 50)) and for automatic progress-report drafting that can be proofread (“automatically generate progress reports using my ADOs and send me a draft for proofreading…” (Participant 72)). Note-taking and meeting recaps were emphasized as high-value time-savers (“Just doing any mundane rote work like taking notes.” (Participant 186); “The killer Copilot feature for me is Recap, allowing me to quickly catch up on meetings I missed.” (Participant 198)). Participants generally framed these capabilities as delegable but expected the final quality-control to remain with them (see oversight themes below).

Sub-themes identified:
- **1.0**: AI is expected to take over repetitive, low-value communication chores: scheduling meetings, generating reports, taking notes, sending routine updates, drafting boilerplate docs/emails. This reduces cognitive load and frees humans for higher-value work.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 50, 72, 117, 186, 198, 357, 327 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Meeting scheduling. Here is a list of names put a meeting on the calendar with a room and Teams link." (Participant 50)
- "I would like the AI to 1) automatically generate progress reports using my ADOs and send me a draft for proof reading…" (Participant 72)
- "Just doing any mundane rote work like taking notes." (Participant 186)

#### Theme: Improving communication clarity and accessibility through tailored support
Developers envision AI as an editor and translator of tone and complexity—an assistant that adapts messages to different stakeholder audiences and linguistic contexts. The description—“AI is envisioned as a clarity enhancer: tailoring communications to different audiences, simplifying technical jargon, and ensuring culturally/linguistically appropriate messaging”—matches participant requests for audience-aware rephrasing (“I would like AI to help with tailoring stakeholder communications to different stakeholders.” (Participant 39)) and simplification (“Rephrase words to stakeholders or client… help to explain the tech details… in an easy understandable way.” (Participant 127)). Multilingual and culturally sensitive phrasing was explicitly requested for non-English contexts (“I want AI suggestions for communication with external partners, particularly when I’m writing in Japanese rather than English… focused comments on correct use of polite forms.” (Participant 175)). Participants expect these outputs to be supervised and adapted to specific stakeholder expectations.

Sub-themes identified:
- **2.0**: AI is envisioned as a clarity enhancer: tailoring communications to different audiences, simplifying technical jargon, and ensuring culturally/linguistically appropriate messaging.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 39, 127, 175, 200, 271 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I would like AI to help with tailoring stakeholder communications to different stakeholders." (Participant 39)
- "Rephrase words to stakeholders or client… help to explain the tech details… in an easy understandable way." (Participant 127)
- "I want AI suggestions for communication with external partners, particularly when I’m writing in Japanese rather than English… focused comments on correct use of polite forms." (Participant 175)

#### Theme: Logistic and Coordination Support
Participants wanted AI to act as a coordination agent—beyond rote chores—helping surface alignment, track next steps, and orchestrate cross-functional calendar and communication workflows. The description—“AI as a coordination agent: handling scheduling, surfacing alignment across goals and teams, and supporting project-level coordination”—reflects requests for meeting prep, personal agent behaviors, and day-to-day prioritization (“Be my personal agent. Keep track of my work and thoughts and be able to attend meetings or answer some questions on my behalf.” (Participant 204)). People see this as distinct from mere automation because it requires understanding project context and suggesting actions (“Project management and communication. It can tell where the project goes and where to go and what I should do today (email, ping someone).” (Participant 232)). Boundaries included trust and a need for clarity about when AI is acting versus when humans must intervene.

Sub-themes identified:
- **3.0**: AI as a coordination agent: handling scheduling, surfacing alignment across goals and teams, and supporting project-level coordination. Distinct from rote automation because it’s about orchestration of workflows and alignment.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 142, 172, 204, 232, 403 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Help with meeting and communication, help me find new tools and learnings…" (Participant 142)
- "Be my personal agent. Keep track of my work and thoughts and be able to attend meetings or answer some questions on my behalf." (Participant 204)
- "Helping track alignment across goals and teams. These meta work tasks often consume time but are critical for clarity and coordination." (Participant 403)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Contextual Information Collation and Sensemaking
Developers want AI to reduce fragmentation across meetings, docs, and project systems by synthesizing and summarizing relevant context. The description—“AI to bring together information across sources (meetings, documents, project data) to reduce fragmentation. This also supports onboarding and long-term knowledge transfer.”—captures desires for meeting summaries, document summaries, and searchable onboarding artifacts (“Summarizing meetings and communication, helping draft documentation.” (Participant 217); “Onboarding: search/finding resources; communication: transcription, summaries.” (Participant 385)). Participants expect AI to surface cross-cutting insights (e.g., decisions, action items) and to help codify tacit knowledge for new team members (“Helping me brain dump the knowledge I’ve gained over the years to help customers and onboard new people.” (Participant 401)). They also noted the potential for AI to reduce human bias in customer interaction notes if appropriately managed.

Sub-themes identified:
- **4.0**: AI to bring together information across sources (meetings, documents, project data) to reduce fragmentation. This also supports onboarding and long-term knowledge transfer.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 163, 164, 217, 271, 369, 385, 401 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Summarizing technical documents, writing communications." (Participant 164)
- "Summarizing meetings and communication, helping draft documentation." (Participant 217)
- "Onboarding: search/finding resources; communication: transcription, summaries." (Participant 385)

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Need for human oversight
Participants consistently insisted that AI-generated communications require human review before being sent due to hallucination risk and potential inaccuracies. The provided description—“Participants insist on reviewing, editing, or approving AI-generated communication before sending to avoid hallucinations or errors.”—is echoed across responses. Several respondents said AI could draft but must not act autonomously (“I don't want it to send emails on my behalf without me proof reading first.” (Participant 72); “Shouldn't send an email without my permission/viewing it first.” (Participant 102)). Others framed oversight as a spectrum: AI could assist to various extents, but full autonomy was unacceptable (“I believe AI can handle all of them to some extent, but I wouldn't want AI to be entirely autonomous. There should still be varying levels of human oversight depending on the task.” (Participant 204)).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Participants insist on reviewing, editing, or approving AI-generated communication before sending to avoid hallucinations or errors.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 17, 72, 102, 204 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "AI should definitely not be the primary factor in documentation, communication, or mentoring/onboarding. Its tendency to hallucinate is too great to risk in these areas without significant human oversight." (Participant 17)
- "I don't want it to send emails on my behalf without me proof reading first." (Participant 72)
- "Shouldn't send an email without my permission/viewing it first." (Participant 102)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Authenticity and personal touch (empathy, trust, dynamics)
Many participants stressed that certain communications—especially those that build trust, convey empathy, or involve leadership—should retain human voice and authenticity. The description—“Emphasis on genuine human voice, empathy, and authentic relationship-building, especially for managers and team leaders.”—reflects concerns that AI templates would erode relationships or misrepresent intent. Multiple respondents said managers and leaders should personally craft messages to maintain authenticity (“I don't want AI to write emails… we should all (managers in particular) express our authentic selves to our colleagues.” (Participant 175); “Client communication needs to have a personal touch. Summarizing meetings is one thing, but replacing real touch points is too much.” (Participant 217)). Several said they simply prefer to write important messages themselves (“I do not use AI to write emails or docs. If I expect a human to read it, I'm going to take the time to write it myself.” (Participant 167)).

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Emphasis on genuine human voice, empathy, and authentic relationship-building, especially for managers and team leaders.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 123, 167, 172, 175, 217, 304 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI directly communicating on my behalf." (Participant 123)
- "I do not use AI to write emails or docs. If I expect a human to read it, I'm going to take the time to write it myself." (Participant 167)
- "I don’t want AI to handle sensitive stakeholder communications… these require empathy, trust-building, and nuanced understanding of team dynamics." (Participant 172)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Privacy and risk concerns
Respondents raised confidentiality and data-handling worries about AI managing stakeholder or client communications. The description—“Concern about mishandling sensitive information, confidentiality breaches, and risks tied to hallucinations.”—captures fears that AI could expose or mishandle private customer data or produce inaccurate claims. Participants explicitly described communications with customers and stakeholders as high-risk and needing tight control (“E2E customer communications, want to oversee communications closely.” (Participant 160); “Client/Stakeholder Communication as its risky in terms for privacy.” (Participant 180)). These concerns often motivated demands for constrained AI roles or opt-ins.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Concern about mishandling sensitive information, confidentiality breaches, and risks tied to hallucinations.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 160, 180, 188, 329 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "E2E customer communications, want to oversee communications closely." (Participant 160)
- "Client/Stakeholder Communication as its risky in terms for privacy." (Participant 180)
- "I don't think AI should be handling communication with stakeholders." (Participant 188)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Limited usefulness for niche communication
Some participants judged AI less valuable for infrequent, highly contextual, or precision-dependent communications. The description—“Some saw little value since their communication tasks are rare, context-specific, or inherently human.”—captures their stance that standard models (e.g., ChatGPT) are not helpful when messages are specialized or rare (“Customer communication for me is rare and precise enough that standard chatGPT AI is not that useful.” (Participant 189)). Others said AI can only suggest options, not replace human judgment (“communication with the client and stakeholders. AI should suggest what can be done.” (Participant 332)). This perspective establishes a boundary where the ROI of AI assistance is low.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Some saw little value since their communication tasks are rare, context-specific, or inherently human.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 23, 189, 237, 259, 332 → rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Communicating with coworkers." (Participant 23)
- "Customer communication for me is rare and precise enough that standard chatGPT AI is not that useful." (Participant 189)
- "AI should suggest what can be done." (Participant 332)

Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to reduce mundane load (scheduling, recaps, boilerplate) and to synthesize fragmented context, but they simultaneously fear errors, loss of authenticity, and privacy breaches. This creates a complementarity where AI is valued as a productivity amplifier but only under strict human control and privacy safeguards.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance is explicitly conditional. Participants are comfortable delegating repetitive tasks (scheduling, transcription, draft generation) and receiving audience/tone suggestions, but they require human review before any outbound message is sent. They are more willing to accept AI assistance when it is framed as a suggestion or draft, not an autonomous actor.

- Task-specific nuances: Client/stakeholder communication uniquely balances factual accuracy, relational dynamics, and legal/privacy constraints. Unlike internal code tasks, stakeholder messages carry reputational and legal risk and require empathy. That makes summarization and coordination tools attractive, but full automation unacceptable for sensitive or relationship-building communications.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is earned through accuracy, provenance, and controllability. Participants want clear signals when AI has generated content, easy editability, and mechanisms for oversight (e.g., preview & approve flows, audit trails). There is notable expectation that AI should augment rather than replace human judgment—especially for messages that affect trust or confidentiality.

---

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Contradictory individual positions: Some participants appear in both “want” and “don’t want” lists (e.g., Participant 72 wants automated progress-report drafts but also insists on proofreading before sending). Participant 204 wants an AI personal agent but also emphasizes varying levels of human oversight. These mixed positions show pragmatic acceptance: participants want assistance but not unchecked autonomy.

- Minority skepticism about utility: A subset sees low ROI because their stakeholder communications are infrequent, highly specific, or require personal touch (Participants 189, 237). For them, AI suggestions are acceptable but rarely used.

- Ambivalent desires: Several quotes reveal both appreciation for AI recaps and concerns about authenticity—participants want meeting summaries and autogenerated notes, yet fear such outputs could become substitutes for human outreach.

- Unique insight on bias reduction: One participant noted AI note-taking could reduce human biases in customer interaction logs (Participant 369). This is a positive edge case suggesting AI might improve fairness/consistency if properly designed.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Overall, developers expect AI to automate repetitive meta-work, synthesize context, and tailor communications—so long as the system preserves human oversight, authenticity, and privacy. Tools should be designed as augmentation platforms with configurable autonomy levels and strong provenance and privacy safeguards.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Drafting and Recap Automation**
  - Capability: Auto-generate meeting recaps, progress-report drafts, and boilerplate emails that are easily editable.
  - Rationale: Participants want to reduce rote work and quickly catch up on missed meetings. ("The killer Copilot feature for me is Recap…" — Participant 198)

- **Audience-Aware Rewriting & Tone Guidance**
  - Capability: Suggest rephrasings tailored to stakeholder type, technical level, and cultural/language norms, with examples for different tones.
  - Rationale: Participants asked for help simplifying technical details and adapting tone (e.g., polite forms in Japanese). ("Rephrase words to stakeholders… explain the tech details in an easy understandable way." — Participant 127)

- **Contextual Collation & Searchable Summaries**
  - Capability: Aggregate meeting notes, docs, and project data into searchable summaries and onboarding artifacts; surface decisions and action items.
  - Rationale: Developers want to reduce fragmentation and accelerate onboarding. ("Helping me brain dump the knowledge I’ve gained… to help onboard new people." — Participant 401)

- **Coordination Assistant with Action Suggestions**
  - Capability: Recommend next steps, prioritize communication actions (who to ping, when to schedule), and highlight alignment issues across goals/teams.
  - Rationale: Participants want orchestration beyond rote tasks for day-to-day prioritization. ("It can tell where the project goes and where to go and what I should do today." — Participant 232)

- **Human-in-the-loop Controls & Provenance**
  - Capability: Preview-and-approve flows, visible provenance tags for AI-sourced content, and easy edit/rollback.
  - Rationale: Participants insist on oversight to avoid hallucinations and mistaken autonomous sends. ("I don't want it to send emails on my behalf without me proofreading first." — Participant 72)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Unreviewed Autonomous Outbound Messaging**
  - Risk: AI sending emails or messages without explicit human approval can cause errors, hallucinations, and relationship damage.
  - Example: "Shouldn't send an email without my permission/viewing it first." (Participant 102)

- **Opaque Data Handling / Weak Privacy Protections**
  - Risk: Allowing AI to access or transmit sensitive stakeholder/customer data without strict controls risks confidentiality breaches.
  - Example: "Client/Stakeholder Communication as its risky in terms for privacy." (Participant 180)

- **Replacing Authentic Managerial Communication**
  - Risk: Automating messages that require empathy/trust-building undermines authentic leadership and team dynamics.
  - Example: "I don't want AI to write emails… managers in particular express our authentic selves…" (Participant 175)

- **One-size-fits-all Tone or Cultural Outputs**
  - Risk: Generic templates that ignore cultural/language nuance can create offense or miscommunication.
  - Example: Need for culture-specific politeness when writing in Japanese. (Participant 175)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop defaults: All outbound communications default to “draft mode” requiring explicit human approval; provide quick-approve flows for trusted templates to reduce friction.

- Role- and audience-aware personas: Allow users to select stakeholder persona (e.g., executive, technical partner, external client) so AI tailors tone and content while surfacing suggested changes and cultural notes.

- Provenance and confidence indicators: Tag content with source excerpts and confidence scores; link suggested statements to transcripts or documentation to reduce hallucination risk.

- Scoped privacy containers: Let users designate "sensitive" conversations or data domains that restrict AI access or confine processing to on-device/enterprise-controlled models.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI for rote automation (scheduling, drafts, recaps) and for collating fragmented context across meetings and docs to free time for higher-value work.
- They resist AI autonomy for outgoing stakeholder communication without human oversight, especially where authenticity, empathy, or confidentiality matter.
- Design must prioritize editable drafts, audience-aware rewriting, contextual summaries, coordination suggestions, and explicit human-in-the-loop controls.
- Guardrails should forbid unreviewed outbound messaging, enforce strong privacy/provenance features, and prevent AI from substituting for managerial authenticity.
- A practical resolution is configurable automation: role-aware personas, preview/approve workflows, provenance labels, and privacy-scoped processing.
- Recommendation: Build AI features that augment daily meta-work while making control, provenance, and privacy obvious and easy—this balances productivity gains with the trust and authenticity developers insist on.
