# Thematic Analysis — Refactoring, Maintenance & Updates

This analysis synthesizes developer survey responses that specifically addressed Refactoring, Maintenance & Updates. I coded and clustered statements about where participants want AI help and where they explicitly do not, paying attention to task value (toil vs. creative work), accountability, required context, and cognitive demands. Themes reflect recurrent needs (automation, comprehension, testing), common fears (untrusted autonomy, loss of context), and conditions participants placed on AI use (human review, strong CI, scope limits).

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automating repetitive refactoring and boilerplate work  
   - Description: Participants consistently want AI to take on the tedious, well-defined parts of refactoring and maintenance—tasks like local refactors, removing duplication, applying consistent style, generating or converting boilerplate, and simple code transformations. The motivation is efficiency and reducing cognitive toil so developers can focus on higher‑level design. Many expect AI to perform these tasks reliably when changes are small, well-scoped, and backed by tests or CI; they want AI to propose PRs, create explainers, and generate tests alongside code changes so human reviewers can accept or modify them.  
   - Number of participants: ~50 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Refactoring for sure. It's often the most boring task for me, and being able to mostly automate it would be amazing."* (Participant 1)  
     - *"Refactoring would be the biggest help! It's almost always tedious and well-defined tasks."* (Participant 26)  
     - *"AI can take on some of the time‑intensive but repetitive refactoring work or routine boilerplate code generation."* (Participant 203)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Codebase comprehension and cross‑codebase/global change support  
   - Description: Developers want AI that understands large repositories, maps related files, and reasons about how a single change propagates across modules (e.g., type changes, nullability, API contract changes). The need is for cross‑file, cross‑module awareness so multi‑step edits and architectural consequences are surfaced; participants expect AI to point to affected files, suggest consistent edits, and provide human‑readable explanations to support safe multi‑file refactors. This is motivated by the difficulty of manual impact analysis in large, legacy codebases.  
   - Number of participants: ~45 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"More cross-codebase awareness... AI will help implement those changes across the rest of the codebase."* (Participant 2)  
     - *"Improvements in understanding large code bases and drawing architectural conclusions will be necessary..."* (Participant 47)  
     - *"I want it to be able to understand a full code base and be able to answer common language questions about it."* (Participant 85)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Test, CI, PR automation and monitoring to reduce regression risk  
   - Description: Many participants want AI to generate unit and integration tests, create PRs with clear explainers, detect build failures, and propose fixes or remediation steps. They see AI as valuable when it augments CI (auto‑testing, identifying regressions) and when it produces artifacts that help humans validate changes (test coverage, PR descriptions). The condition is that AI's outputs must be verifiable and integrated into existing CI workflows to manage risk.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Automating the PR creations and explainers to describe the changes. Creating extensive tests..."* (Participant 160)  
     - *"Auto gen test cases, handle deployment pipelines, identify build failures and make an attempt to auto fix..."* (Participant 192)  
     - *"When doing simple configuration tasks... it asks follow up questions and proposes a PR."* (Participant 205)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Dependency, upgrade, and migration assistance  
   - Description: Participants expect AI to assist with library upgrades, version migrations, and repetitive maintenance tasks across projects. They want AI to automate mundane upgrade steps, identify duplication across repos, and help migrate old technology to new stacks—especially when upgrades follow predictable patterns. The desired outcome is faster, less error‑prone maintenance; participants often conditioned this on AI being version‑aware and able to propose safe, testable changes.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Library upgrades. Such as major version upgrades of libraries for existing applications."* (Participant 50)  
     - *"Cloud based coding agent, for migration of old tech to new tech."* (Participant 7)  
     - *"Refactoring, and maintenance, including regular security fixes takes a lot of bandwidth... AI has a good scope here."* (Participant 271)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Autonomous large‑scale refactoring or rewrites without human oversight  
   - Description: A prominent concern is AI performing broad, autonomous refactors or introducing sweeping structural changes without interactive review. Developers fear uncontrolled rewrites that alter architecture, add files, or deviate from established patterns, producing regressions or maintenance burdens. The boundary is clear: AI is acceptable as a proposal engine, but final authority and responsibility must remain with humans; many demanded human review, smaller scoped changes, and previewable diffs before application.  
   - Number of participants: ~35 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first."* (Participant 39)  
     - *"Automatically change code without user review."* (Participant 21)  
     - *"AI should not perform any large-scale refactoring or optimizations."* (Participant 182)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Performance optimization and complex bug fixes (high‑context tasks)  
   - Description: Many developers expressed that AI is not yet trusted for performance tuning, complex debugging, or fixes requiring deep domain/contextual knowledge. Concerns center on incorrect or surface‑level optimizations that break carefully balanced designs or introduce subtle bugs. The feared outcome is regressions and wasted review time; participants prefer AI to suggest possibilities rather than autonomously apply optimizations, and to defer to humans for high‑impact performance work.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to handle performance optimization automatically... it will rewrite things ... without understanding the big picture."* (Participant 39)  
     - *"I don't want AI to handle tasks that are too difficult for it. Currently, that includes performance optimisation, refactoring..."* (Participant 189)  
     - *"Performance optimizations, design, code structures" (No AI wanted)* (Participant 252)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Structural and tribal‑knowledge changes that break existing conventions  
   - Description: Participants worry about AI introducing changes that violate team coding patterns, add/remove files or imports, or ignore domain‑specific "tribal" knowledge. These actions reduce readability, hamper onboarding, and make future maintenance harder. The condition many set is that AI may recommend structure changes only when explicitly instructed, with clear rationale and human approval, and ideally accompanied by tests and migration plans.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI agents to add, remove, and heavily change my code structure, like new files, new subfolders..."* (Participant 18)  
     - *"Heavy refactoring of code, especially when not adhering to existing coding patterns... to the point that the original context is lost."* (Participant 111)  
     - *"I can't trust the AI to be correct, and when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing..."* (Participant 325)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: High‑stakes production tasks, security fixes, and deployments without human control  
   - Description: Several participants explicitly reject AI taking charge of production CI/CD, deployments, or security patches without strict controls. The concerns are about accountability, safety, and the potential for customer‑impacting incidents. They accept AI assistance in preparing fixes or pipelines, but not autonomous execution in production; human review, approvals, and audit trails are essential.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Deployments and literally anything to do relating to security" (No AI wanted)* (Participant 349)  
     - *"I am generally skeptical in all the CI/CD activities done by AI in prod... would still prefer developers to handle it."* (Participant 287)  
     - *"Anything that needs to be maintained, readable, and understandable in the future" (No AI wanted)* (Participant 108)  
   - Confidence: High

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections between wants and don't‑wants: Developers want AI to reduce toil (refactors, tests, boilerplate, upgrades) but explicitly reject AI autonomy for large or high‑impact changes. In practice they prefer AI to be a proposal agent that produces testable PRs, explanations, and change summaries rather than an automated committer.
- Tensions and contradictions: Many respondents simultaneously ask for AI to "do refactoring" and warn that AI is bad at large refactors—this reveals a key tension: AI is desired for small, well‑scoped refactors but distrusted for broad architectural changes. A smaller subset either fully embraces AI autonomy or fully rejects any AI handling, showing polarized risk tolerance.
- Conditions and boundaries placed on AI usage: Common constraints include the need for strong CI/test coverage before automated application, human‑in‑the‑loop approval, scope limits (local vs. repo‑wide), explainability (why a change is suggested), version‑awareness for upgrades, and the ability to preview/revert changes.

### Relation to other tasks
- Several participants compared refactoring/maintenance to tasks like debugging, architecture, and deployments. They often placed maintenance/refactoring in the middle: more acceptable for AI than architecture/design or production deployments, but less acceptable than trivial scripting or documentation. Where comparisons were explicit, participants treated maintenance tasks as acceptable AI targets only when verifiability and human oversight were present.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full‑automation proponents: A few participants (e.g., Participant 330) believe AI could eventually handle all development heavy activities if properly trained; these voices urge maximal automation and broader trust.
- Full rejection proponents: Conversely, participants like 167 explicitly do not want AI to "handle" any of it due to accountability concerns, only accepting AI as a reviewer.
- Skeptical productivity trade‑offs: Several respondents reported that current AI refactoring can be slower or worse than manual work (Participants 35, 195), highlighting that poor tooling can add review overhead rather than save time.
- Educational role: Some participants want AI primarily as an educator/guide (e.g., explaining dependency injection before touching unfamiliar code), which is distinct from automated change application and important for adoption in teams.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

High-level takeaway: Developers welcome AI that reduces repetitive maintenance toil and improves cross‑file awareness—but only if AI operates transparently, produces verifiable artifacts (tests, PRs, explanations), and keeps humans in control of high‑risk or high‑context changes.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Human‑in‑the‑loop PR generation
  - Capability: Propose changes as PRs with clear, line‑level diffs, rationale, and impact summary so humans can review and accept or reject; include test suggestions and rollback steps. Rationale: aligns with demand for proposals rather than autonomous commits.
- Scoped, previewable refactor operations
  - Capability: Allow users to define and constrain the scope (file set, module, or change type) and preview the full set of edits before applying. Rationale: reduces fear of uncontrolled, wide‑ranging rewrites.
- Cross‑repo and dependency awareness
  - Capability: Map related files, show where a change would ripple, and highlight dependent modules or APIs. Rationale: supports multi‑file changes and reduces missed impacts.
- Test generation and CI integration
  - Capability: Auto‑generate unit/integration tests, run them in CI emulations, and surface failures; tie suggested changes to passing test runs. Rationale: reduces regression risk and increases trust.
- Explainability and traceability
  - Capability: Provide concise explanations ("why this change?"), link to source examples, and maintain an audit trail of AI decisions. Rationale: addresses accountability and learning needs.
- Version and package awareness
  - Capability: Use up‑to‑date package documentation and migration notes when proposing library upgrades or migrations; if uncertain, flag the unknowns. Rationale: avoids wrong assumptions for upgrades.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous, unsupervised broad refactors
  - Anti‑pattern: Allowing AI to push large structural changes or new files to production without explicit human approval.
- Silent rewrites that break team conventions
  - Anti‑pattern: Applying format/design/structural changes that conflict with established patterns without explaining or obtaining consent.
- Unchecked production deployments or security patching
  - Anti‑pattern: Letting AI automatically execute production deployment or critical security changes without human approval and auditing.
- Applying optimizations without global understanding
  - Anti‑pattern: Making performance changes that alter architecture or semantics without providing full contextual justification and testing evidence.

Optional design pattern to resolve tensions: implement a “proposal + simulation” flow—AI suggests changes, simulates CI/test results, provides diff and rationale, and requires an explicit accept step. This reconciles the desire for automation with the need for human control.

## Short Summary / Recommendations

- Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive maintenance tasks (local refactors, boilerplate, tests) and for helping understand large codebases, but they want AI to act as a proposer, not an autonomous committer.
- Trust hinges on verifiability: integrate AI outputs with CI, auto‑generated tests, and clear PRs so reviewers can validate changes before acceptance.
- Strong human‑in‑the‑loop controls are essential—scoped operations, previewable diffs, approvals, and audit trails reduce risk and speed adoption.
- Avoid allowing AI to perform unsupervised large‑scale refactors, production deployments, or security changes; these must require explicit human sign‑off.
- Provide explainability and context awareness (cross‑file impact mapping, package/version knowledge) so AI suggestions are actionable and respect team conventions.

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to automate tedious refactors, boilerplate, and repetitive maintenance to reduce toil and speed delivery.  
- AI that understands entire repositories and highlights cross‑file impacts is highly valued for safe, multi‑file changes.  
- Test generation, PR creation, and CI integration are crucial: AI outputs must be verifiable and accompanied by explainers and tests.  
- Strong reservations exist about autonomous, large‑scale refactors, performance optimizations, and production deployments; human review and scope limits are required.  
- Tooling must prioritize previewable proposals, scoped changes, explainability, version awareness, and auditability to gain trust.
