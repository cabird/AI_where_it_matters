# Thematic Analysis — Research & Brainstorming

I reviewed participants' short responses and focused only on the sentences and clauses that explicitly address Research & Brainstorming. I grouped recurring ideas into coherent themes, counted how many respondents raised each idea (rounded to the nearest five), and extracted short representative quotes. Where participants expressed mixed or conditional views I captured those nuances in the theme descriptions.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Rapid information retrieval, knowledge discovery and summarization  
   - Description: Developers want AI to act as a research assistant that can scan large bodies of documentation and research, collate and summarize relevant material, and surface key findings quickly. The motivation is efficiency — to reduce time spent hunting through sources and to turn scattered information into actionable knowledge. Desired outcomes include concise syntheses, prioritized relevant links, and cited sources so engineers can follow up. Many users framed this as acceptable only when the AI provides provenance or when outputs are treated as starting points for human validation rather than unquestioned facts.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Researching should be where AI plays a big role... pick out relevant information from large amounts of research data."* (Participant 28)  
     - *"AI is great for research, as long as it cites sources."* (Participant 20)  
     - *"auto collation and summarization of resources from different sources."* (Participant 336)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Brainstorming and idea scaffolding (sounding-board, roadmaps, task breakdowns)  
   - Description: Several developers want AI to support the ideation phase by acting as a sounding board, suggesting directions, breaking high‑level ideas into roadmaps and task lists, and generating prototype concepts. The appeal is that AI can accelerate iteration and help structure fuzzy thinking, but participants often framed this as assistance rather than replacement — they expect AI to facilitate exploration and organization while the human owns final creative judgment. Boundary conditions include preferring AI to propose options and questions, not to make irreversible decisions.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Be my personal agent. Keep track my work and thoughts..."* (Participant 204)  
     - *"Create roadmap and breakdown of tasks when given high level idea..."* (Participant 160)  
     - *"AI can be OK ... as a sounding board for research..."* (Participant 17)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Documentation-related research support (validation, issue-finding, prototypes)  
   - Description: Many respondents tied research help to documentation tasks: validating documentation, finding issues, producing automatic documentation from code, and using research outputs to inform quick prototypes. The motivation is reducing repetitive toil (keeping docs current, finding inconsistencies) and making research outputs immediately useful (e.g., prototype code). Participants expect AI to speed routine parts of research-to-doc workflow but still wanted human review for correctness.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Documentation validation, and suggestions for changes..."* (Participant 54)  
     - *"Find issues in documentation. Help with research and creating working prototypes."* (Participant 148)  
     - *"Documentation and research"*(Participant 79)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Personalized learning and curated study material from research outputs  
   - Description: Several developers want AI to tailor research and learning resources to their existing knowledge and projects so that studying new technologies is efficient. The motivation is faster ramp-up and focused learning; the desired outcome is personalized materials, guided paths, and explanations that fit the developer’s context. Some noted a trade-off: AI can accelerate learning but may reduce "learning by doing" if relied upon excessively.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Learning new technologies as well as Research. ML currently cuts down time..."* (Participant 195)  
     - *"I want it take into account my own knowledge and experience to provide study materials."* (Participant 280)  
     - *"learning new technologies."* (Participant 10)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Preserve human creativity — don't outsource core ideation/brainstorming  
   - Description: A clear group of developers resist outsourcing the core creative work of brainstorming and idea generation to AI. They worry that letting AI do ideation robs engineers of cognitive practice and ownership; brainstorming is viewed as an exercise in thinking, growth, and problem formulation that should remain human-led. Acceptable AI roles in this space are limited to prompting or facilitating, not replacing the human creative engine.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Research and brainstorming require a lot of human creativity... I don't want AI to interfere."* (Participant 18)  
     - *"Brainstorming because I Want to use my own brain and force myself to think"* (Participant 366)  
     - *"we shouldn't go with its first ideas to solve a problem."* (Participant 217)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Trust, accuracy, provenance — AI is unreliable/hallucinates for research  
   - Description: Many participants said they will not trust AI for research when outputs are incorrect, outdated, or unreferenced. The core concern is that confident-sounding but wrong answers lead to wasted work or incorrect conclusions. Developers want citation and clear provenance; some explicitly prefer official docs over AI outputs. The feared outcome is being misled by wrong or stale claims, so human verification and source links are a common required boundary.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't trust Copilot for helping me research, it's often wrong or outdated..."* (Participant 353)  
     - *"I don't want to give full control to AI for deep thought and analysis for research... learn/understand its sources for myself."* (Participant 142)  
     - *"it's not good enough to come up with new solutions yet."* (Participant 262)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Not suitable for high‑stakes design/decisions or final selection of ideas  
   - Description: Respondents pushed back on using AI to make or own major architectural or design decisions that have long-term consequences. The concern is accountability and the need for nuanced judgment that takes into account context, trade-offs, and team norms. Participants allowed AI to propose options but insisted humans must evaluate and choose the final approach. This boundary often extended to other critical activities like customer communication and mentoring.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Taking decisions on architecture"* (Participant 7)  
     - *"Design decisions."* (Participant 161)  
     - *"I do not want AI to handle ... thinking/brainstorming for engineers..."* (Participant 228)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Learning and growth trade-offs — AI can short-circuit developer learning  
   - Description: A smaller subset worried AI could reduce opportunities to learn through struggle, mentoring, and hands-on problem solving. They feared that over-reliance on AI for research/brainstorming would erode skills, mentoring moments, and the cognitive work that produces growth. Some would accept AI help for low-value or repetitive research but not for learning-critical tasks.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"It is not so great at actually learning new techs as it does the work for you and you miss a chance to learn by doing."* (Participant 66)  
     - *"mentoring requires empathy... these are activities that humans need to do to grow themselves."* (Participant 228)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections between wants and don't wants: Most participants accept AI as a labor‑saving tool for retrieval, summarization, and scaffolding (research, documentation, and synthesizing resources) but reject delegation of final creative judgment or decision‑making. Many comments pair a positive use-case ("summarize, cite") with a boundary ("human validation required"), making human-in-the-loop the central organizing principle.
- Tensions/contradictions: Several respondents expressed both desire for AI help in brainstorming and simultaneous reluctance to outsource ideation (e.g., calling AI a "sounding board" but not a replacement). A few participants explicitly reported both WANT and DON'T WANT for brainstorming, reflecting ambivalence driven by uneven current model quality and a desire for controlled assistance rather than replacement.
- Conditions/boundaries: Frequent conditions include requirement for citations/provenance, human review before acceptance, facilitation modes (suggest/question) rather than authoritative modes (decide/execute), and preserving tasks that are important for learning or accountability (architecture, mentoring, client communication).

### Relation to other tasks
- Participants contrasted Research & Brainstorming with architecture/design decisions, client communication, mentoring, and documentation. They were generally more willing to let AI help with documentation and knowledge collation than with client-facing or high-stakes design decisions.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Mixed responses: Participants 17, 288, and 362 explicitly combined acceptance and reluctance — e.g., AI as a "sounding board" or "good to discuss" but not as a replacement. These indicate a preference for controlled, conversational assistance.
- Strong pro-AI outliers: A few participants wrote "Everything" or "All aspects!" (7, 23) but even one of those (7) carved out architecture as off-limits — demonstrating that few, if any, want unbounded autonomy.
- Negative-experience drivers: Several participants refused AI for research based primarily on past poor outputs (e.g., 292, 353). These responses suggest trust can shift quickly based on individual experiences.
- Agent desire: Participant 204 wanted an agent that could keep long-term context and "attend meetings," which could affect research workflows if implemented — this is a forward-looking edge case where AI becomes an active assistant across research tasks.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers welcome AI as a research accelerator and facilitator, provided it is transparent, source-aware, and positioned as a collaborator rather than an authority. Tools should default to assistive, explainable modes that preserve human oversight and learning opportunities.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Source citation and provenance
  - Provide clear, linkable citations and timestamps for all factual claims so users can verify and follow up.
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
  - Modes that encourage review (e.g., "suggestions with rationale" vs "final recommendation") and require explicit user acceptance for design decisions.
- Summarization and collation capabilities
  - High-quality summarization of multiple sources, prioritized relevance, and extractable snippets for documentation or prototypes.
- Configurable facilitation modes
  - "Brainstorm facilitator" mode that asks questions and generates options, and a separate "solution proposal" mode that flags confidence and assumptions.
- Personalization and context awareness
  - Remember project context and the user's skill level to tailor learning materials and research outputs without supplanting hands-on learning.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Do not claim unverified facts with high confidence
  - Avoid presenting hallucinations or out-of-date information without provenance.
- Do not auto-apply or auto-finalize high-stakes design choices
  - Never allow AI to make irreversible architectural decisions without human sign-off.
- Do not obscure ownership and learning opportunities
  - Avoid workflows that remove the developer from essential reasoning steps that build skills and accountability.

Optional design pattern to resolve tensions:
- Dual-mode interaction: always surface AI-generated ideas as "candidate options" with provenance and an explicit "confidence & assumptions" panel; provide a toggle to switch to an "exercise mode" that constrains AI suggestions to prompts and questions to preserve user ideation.

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for research tasks that involve scanning, summarizing, and collating information — especially when outputs include citations and provenance.
- Many want AI to act as a brainstorming facilitator and roadmap generator, but not as a replacement for human creativity or final decision-making.
- Documentation and research-driven prototype support are popular, provided outputs are reviewed and validated by humans.
- Major barriers are trust and accuracy: hallucinations, outdated information, and lack of sources make AI-generated research unreliable without human verification.
- Designers should prioritize provenance, configurable assistive modes (facilitator vs. proposer), and explicit human-in-the-loop approval for design/architecture choices to avoid undermining learning and accountability.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize summarization with source links and timestamps.  
- Offer a "facilitator" interaction mode that prompts and questions rather than prescribes.  
- Require human review and explicit acceptance for architecture/design recommendations.  
- Surface confidence, assumptions, and provenance for every research claim.  
- Provide personalization for learning paths while encouraging hands-on practice to protect developer growth.
