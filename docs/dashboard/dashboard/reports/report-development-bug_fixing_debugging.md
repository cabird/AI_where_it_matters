# Thematic Analysis — Bug Fixing/Debugging

I reviewed participant responses and focused only on the portions explicitly about bug fixing and debugging. I coded recurring ideas, grouped them into coherent themes for where developers want AI help and where they do not, and noted tensions and design implications. Counts below are approximate and rounded to the nearest 5; participants often mentioned multiple ideas so themes overlap.

---

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automating repetitive, low‑risk debugging tasks and test generation  
   - Description: Many developers want AI to take over low‑cognitive, repetitive aspects of debugging—generating boilerplate tests, writing simple unit tests, producing reproducible scripts, and handling routine error‑finding chores—so humans can focus on higher‑value reasoning. The motivation is efficiency and reduced toil: participants expect AI to speed up test coverage, produce useful starting points for fixes, and catch simple mistakes (typos, copy/paste errors). Conditions include keeping AI outputs small, isolated, and easily validated (e.g., unit tests or simple scripts), and preserving human review for any change that affects production behavior.  
   - Number of participants: ~95 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Automating repetitive tasks like boilerplate code generation, build configuration, and writing test cases."* (Participant 57)  
     - *"Auto gen test cases, handle deployment pipelines, identify build failures and make an attempt to auto fix..."* (Participant 192)  
     - *"Catch my slip‑ups (like a bad copy‑paste); Saving keystrokes by predicting code."* (Participant 149)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 2. Theme: Log, trace, and cross‑system root cause analysis (RCA) and production incident support  
   - Description: A strong cluster of responses asked for AI that can correlate logs, stack traces, test failures, and dynamic/debugger state to surface probable root causes across components and services. The motivation is reducing the heavy manual work of hunting through distributed logs and reproducing issues; developers expect AI to triage incidents, map errors to code locations, and propose targeted fixes or reproduction steps. Boundaries include limits on AI performing unsupervised fixes in production and requirements for connectors to internal logs and dynamic traces.  
   - Number of participants: ~80 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Correlating with logs for self‑debugging"* (Participant 25)  
     - *"Root causing live site incidents"* (Participant 80)  
     - *"AI to do a lot of the investigation into bug reports... suggest what the fix should be and ask an experienced engineer for approval."* (Participant 117)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 3. Theme: In‑editor, real‑time bug detection and coding‑time guidance  
   - Description: Participants want AI to spot likely bugs while they write code—flagging slip‑ups, offering context‑aware suggestions, and giving immediate feedback so defects are prevented earlier. The motivation is catching errors early (shift-left), reducing context switches, and preserving developer flow. Desired outcomes include code review–style checks in real time and style/UX/library choices tuned to project conventions; boundaries include keeping suggestions explainable and avoiding large, opaque replacements that obscure intent.  
   - Number of participants: ~70 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code! I want it to give me code review feedback in real time."* (Participant 167)  
     - *"I want AI to review my code and provide help/analysis with the mundane parts... assist in debugging or understanding code..."* (Participant 142)  
     - *"It should act as a smart assistant that boosts productivity without compromising code quality or control."* (Participant 241)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 4. Theme: Proposing fixes, PRs, and change explanations with human‑in‑the‑loop approval  
   - Description: Several developers asked for AI that can suggest concrete fixes, prepare PRs with explanations, and produce tests and changelogs—while leaving final approval and high‑risk decisions to humans. The motivation is to accelerate triage-to-fix cycles and reduce friction in routine bug resolution. The boundary is clear: suggestions should be accompanied by rationale, tests, and impact analysis and must require human validation before merging, especially in unfamiliar or complex codebases.  
   - Number of participants: ~60 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"If it confirms there is a bug... it can suggest what the fix should be and ask an experienced engineer for approval to make the fix."* (Participant 117)  
     - *"Automating the PR creations and explainers to describe the changes."* (Participant 160)  
     - *"Help write unit tests, ensure that changes will not break anything."* (Participant 206)  
   - Confidence: High


### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Critical, security‑sensitive, or high‑stakes bug fixes (no unsupervised AI)  
   - Description: Developers consistently rejected handing over critical or security‑sensitive bug fixes to AI without human oversight. Concerns center on the high cost of mistakes (breaches, outages) and the need for accountability; they want AI only as a reviewer or assistant in these contexts, not as an autonomous fixer. The feared outcome is subtle, high‑impact regressions or vulnerabilities introduced by incorrect automated changes. Conditions include mandatory human review, additional verification, and restricting AI from making direct changes in production or security‑critical paths.  
   - Number of participants: ~110 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Critical Bug Fixes / Security critical tasks - The stakes of missing something critical can lead to a potential breach"* (Participant 37)  
     - *"Anything pertaining to security shouldn't be handled by AI (but perhaps reviewed by it)."* (Participant 188)  
     - *"While I am DRI/On‑call I would not like AI to right away Mitigate the issue and would require Human intervention..."* (Participant 209)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 2. Theme: Deep, complex debugging across unfamiliar, large, or cross‑service systems  
   - Description: Many developers do not trust AI to handle intricate debugging that requires long‑running tacit knowledge, deep system understanding, or cross‑service mental models. The concern is that AI lacks the implicit context engineers have (UX expectations, helper functions, architectural tradeoffs) and may produce superficially working but wrong fixes that introduce regressions. The feared outcome is wasted time chasing AI‑generated but context‑inappropriate fixes and degraded system reliability. Boundaries include allowing AI to suggest leads but requiring experienced engineers to own diagnosis and final solutions.  
   - Number of participants: ~120 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should not be relied on for complex tasks, as it is still very bad at them."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"When coding, multiple steps... informed by implicit knowledge... multi turn AI tools... have lacked that extra context."* (Participant 10)  
     - *"Debugging would be challenging since it would require AI to step through my program and understand the program state...this would be a bit of a security risk."* (Participant 27)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 3. Theme: Loss of developer learning and ownership; concerns about maintainability  
   - Description: Several participants worry that letting AI do substantive debugging or write large portions of code will erode individual and team skill development, reduce understanding of systems, and create code that is hard for humans to maintain. The motivation for resistance is identity and long‑term product quality: developers want to retain opportunities to learn by troubleshooting. Conditions suggested include limiting AI to assistive roles and keeping human authorship for nontrivial fixes.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks that allow those engineers to become better engineers."* (Participant 16)  
     - *"I want AI to stay out of learning. A big part of development is learning, and when folks rely on AI, they don't learn."* (Participant 145)  
     - *"If AI had written entire code base... debugging that code from scratch can increase amount of time taken..."* (Participant 294)  
   - Confidence: Medium


#### 4. Theme: Distrust due to hallucinations, incorrect fixes, and potential regressions  
   - Description: A pervasive theme is mistrust of AI because it can hallucinate, give confidently wrong diagnoses, or propose fixes that introduce new bugs. Developers fear that using untrusted suggestions could increase time spent (verifying and reverting) rather than saving it. Many insist AI outputs must be clearly labeled, explainable, and easy to validate; autonomous or opaque fixes are unacceptable until reliability improves.  
   - Number of participants: ~120 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Anything I can't trust, which is most of AI due to hallucinations"* (Participant 98)  
     - *"AI actions are very frequently incorrect for my primary day‑to‑day activities like development and debugging."* (Participant 357)  
     - *"It wrote code that assumed that every month has 30 days. I wouldn't trust that AI."* (Participant 392)  
   - Confidence: High


#### 5. Theme: Reluctance to grant autonomous, agentic control over machines or production environments  
   - Description: Some participants explicitly rejected giving AI—and agents—direct control to step through runtimes, execute fixes, or access sensitive environments, citing security and accountability risks. They favor AI that proposes actions rather than performs them, and they want human gating for any executed remediation.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"this would be a bit of a security risk for an AI to have that level of control over my machine."* (Participant 27)  
     - *"Agentic tasks - dont feel comfortable letting AI handle complex scenarios on existing platform."* (Participant 192)  
     - *"Agents taking over my job"* (Participant 386)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections between wants and don't‑wants: Developers overwhelmingly want AI to reduce toil—generate tests, triage logs, and suggest fixes—while simultaneously demanding tight human oversight for anything that could cause regressions, security issues, or require deep contextual judgment. Many see AI as an assistant that should do the heavy lifting of gathering evidence and proposing targeted changes rather than an autonomous agent that replaces human decision‑making.

- Tensions or contradictions: There is a strong split between participants who want AI to "handle everything" (often with the caveat of review) and those who want AI limited to peripheral tasks. Some participants simultaneously stated that they want AI to do debugging but also said they do not trust it for complex debugging; this reflects an expectation gap—developers want the outcomes AI could provide but are skeptical of current AI reliability.

- Conditions and boundaries: Commonly stated boundaries are (1) human‑in‑the‑loop approval for fixes, (2) restricting AI from security‑critical or high‑impact changes, (3) requiring explainability/provenance and tests for AI suggestions, and (4) integrating AI with internal logs, debuggers, and version control to provide evidence rather than blind edits.

### Relation to other tasks
- Participants drew contrasts between debugging and broader tasks: many were comfortable with AI doing rote testing, log analysis, and boilerplate changes but explicitly opposed AI making architectural decisions, deep system integrations, or performance optimizations. Several noted that AI might be more acceptable upstream (catching bugs during development) than handling regression fixes on live systems.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Pro‑automation extremes: A few participants wanted AI to "handle it all" and saw no area where AI shouldn't intervene (e.g., Participants 7, 330). These outliers emphasize maximal automation with human validation.

- Strong anti‑AI extremes: Conversely, some participants flatly said AI is “very bad” at long problems and shouldn’t be used for debugging at all (e.g., Participants 199, 215), reflecting strong distrust based on poor prior experience.

- Unique suggestions: Several participants proposed deeper integrations that are not commonly available—AI that consumes dynamic debugger state, pull failure traces with test case context, or actively reproduce and explain regressions with causal reasoning (Participants 276, 281, 117). These are distinctive because they require runtime access and stronger tooling integration.

- Contradictory micro‑positions: Multiple participants both requested AI assistance for debugging and simultaneously stated they prefer to learn/debug themselves first; this suggests developers want AI as a second‑opinion or accelerator rather than a first resort.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want debugging AI that reduces repetitive work and accelerates root cause discovery, but only if it is reliable, explainable, and constrained. Tools that integrate with runtime data, produce testable suggestions, and enforce human approval for risky changes will gain adoption; opaque, autonomous agents that touch production are unlikely to be trusted.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Strong evidence and provenance
  - Show the logs, stack traces, git commits, tests, or runtime snapshots that led to a diagnosis; link to source lines and relevant commits so humans can verify rationale.
- Human‑in‑the‑loop workflows
  - Provide suggested PRs/patches and require explicit human review and tests before merge or deploy; include an easy "revert" and audit trail.
- Debugger and telemetry integration
  - Integrate with debuggers, test runners, telemetry, and log stores so AI can correlate dynamic state and reproduce failures locally where possible.
- Conservative, small changes with tests
  - Prioritize small, isolated fixes accompanied by generated tests and impact analysis to reduce regression risk and increase trust.
- Explainability and code style alignment
  - Explain why a change is suggested, surface trade‑offs, and learn/adhere to repo‑specific helper functions and conventions (RAG of internal docs).

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous production remediation without human approval
  - Never allow AI agents to modify production state or push fixes without explicit human sign‑off and deployment controls.
- Opaque, large‑scale refactors or architectural changes
  - Avoid large automated refactors or performance optimizations that lack clear testing and human review paths.
- Unverified blind fixes without tests or provenance
  - Do not accept patches proposed without reproducible evidence, associated tests, or clear provenance.

(Optional design pattern) Use "suggest‑and‑verify": AI proposes a minimal patch + unit/integration tests, runs the tests in an isolated CI sandbox, and presents results plus logs to the developer for approval.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive debugging tasks: generating tests, triaging logs, and producing small, testable fixes.  
- Strong distrust remains for AI handling critical, security‑sensitive, or complex cross‑service debugging without human oversight.  
- The most desired capabilities are log/trace correlation, in‑editor bug catching, PR/test generation, and evidence‑based root cause suggestions.  
- Major barriers to adoption are hallucinations, opaque reasoning, and the risk of introducing regressions—developers demand provenance, explainability, and human‑in‑the‑loop gates.  
- Tool designers should prioritize debugger/telemetry integration, small changes with autogenerated tests, and conservative workflows that require human approval before any production change.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Build AI features that automate low‑risk, repetitive debugging tasks (test generation, log triage) to reduce toil.  
- Integrate AI with logs, debuggers, and VCS so recommendations include concrete evidence and links to source.  
- Always present fixes as suggested PRs with generated tests and require human approval before merging.  
- Explicitly restrict AI from making autonomous changes in production and from unreviewed security‑critical fixes.  
- Emphasize explainability, provenance, and impact analysis in AI outputs to build developer trust.
