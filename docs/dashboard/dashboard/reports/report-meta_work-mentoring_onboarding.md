# Thematic Analysis — Mentoring & Onboarding

I reviewed each participant’s responses and focused only on statements explicitly about mentoring and onboarding. I coded comments for positive desires (where participants want AI help) and negative boundaries (where participants do not want AI involved), then clustered those codes into coherent themes that capture motivations, specific tasks, concerns, and the conditions participants set for AI use.

---

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automating rote onboarding tasks and configuration
   - Description: Participants want AI to handle repetitive, administrative parts of onboarding — the entitlements, repository cloning, environment setup, checklists and step-by-step walkthroughs that typically create friction for new joiners. The motivation is to reduce toil and speed up time-to-productivity so human mentors can focus on relationship-building and higher-value guidance. The desired outcome is reliable, repeatable onboarding flows that minimize boring manual work; many explicitly want these capabilities paired with human oversight or hand-off to a person at key moments. Boundaries include keeping relationship-building and final judgement with humans and using AI only for deterministic or verifiable steps.
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Using AI for helping new people with the rote steps of onboarding (getting the appropriate entitlements, cloning a repository, and building it) is fine..."* (Participant 70)  
     - *"Walkthrough onboarding process"* (Participant 375)  
     - *"Assist in onboarding, documentation and learning new technologies"* (Participant 157)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Generating and maintaining onboarding documentation and knowledge capture
   - Description: Developers want AI to create, update, and organize the documentation and architectural diagrams that underpin onboarding. The context is producing up-to-date, searchable onboarding materials and boilerplate that reduce the burden on mentors and give newcomers a reliable starting point. The motivation is efficiency and scaling institutional knowledge; the desired outcome is well-structured, discoverable documentation that shortens ramp time. Many respondents add a condition that AI-produced docs need verification and provenance to avoid errors.
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Creating and updating documentation."* (Participant 375)  
     - *"Keep track of work and publish Arch diagrams and documentations"* (Participant 272)  
     - *"Helping me brain dump the knowledge I've gained over the years to help ... onboard new people"* (Participant 401)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Personalized learning plans and training aids
   - Description: Several developers want AI to design individualized training plans, curate learning resources, and accelerate learning of new technologies for new hires. The context is structured mentoring support that focuses on knowledge acquisition rather than interpersonal mentoring. The motivation is to provide tailored, efficient learning pathways and reduce time mentors spend composing curricula; the expected outcome is actionable study plans and resource lists that complement human coaching. Boundaries include keeping high-level judgement and relationship work with people.
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"It has the ability to create learning plans which are very helpful."* (Participant 269)  
     - *"Auto-generated training plan for new onboardings"* (Participant 272)  
     - *"Assist in onboarding, documentation and learning new technologies"* (Participant 157)  
   - Confidence: Medium

#### 4. Theme: On-demand Q&A and troubleshooting support for newcomers
   - Description: Participants want AI as an always-available assistant that answers newcomers’ practical questions, points them to relevant resources, and helps debug common setup problems. The context is interactive support that fills gaps when a human is not immediately available. The motivation is faster problem resolution and reduced interruption of mentors; the desired outcome is a reliable, searchable conversational assistant that escalates to humans when uncertain. Some respondents even imagine the AI taking a stronger facilitation role, though this is more contested.
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Being able to help answer questions for newcomers as well as others who are not familiar with certain domains/fields."* (Participant 379)  
     - *"Onboarding and teaching new joiners"* (Participant 408)  
     - *"help answer questions for newcomers"* (Participant 385)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Core mentoring and relationship-building should remain human
   - Description: A dominant concern is that mentoring and onboarding are fundamentally interpersonal and cultural activities that build rapport, trust, and team identity. Participants argue AI cannot replace empathy, human judgement, or the personal touch required to make a newcomer feel welcomed and integrated. The feared outcome is alienation of new hires and degraded team cohesion if AI replaces human interaction. The clear boundary is that AI may assist with background work but should not be the primary or sole actor in mentoring relationships.
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want AI to handle mentoring. This is a very cultural task that requires human-human communication."* (Participant 10)  
     - *"Mentoring and onboarding to a team should involve humans."* (Participant 50)  
     - *"Onboarding, because new team members need to interact with their team members to build relationships."* (Participant 122)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Trust, accuracy and hallucination risk make AI unsuitable as primary mentor
   - Description: Many respondents worry that AI models hallucinate or produce unreliable guidance, and that errors in mentoring or documentation can be costly. The context is high-stakes teaching: incorrect advice during onboarding can mis-train new hires or propagate bad practices. The concern is loss of accountability and the high cost of being wrong; participants expect human oversight, source-tracing, and conservative use of AI-generated content. The boundary is that AI must not be allowed to operate autonomously in mentoring without human verification.
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Its tendency to hallucinate is too great to risk in these areas without significant human oversight."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"I don't trust a stochastic parrot to be capable of getting it right..."* (Participant 385)  
     - *"I don't want it to do mentoring because the cost of it getting it wrong is terrible and it will get it wrong."* (Participant 357)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Mentoring is part of professional growth and identity — don't outsource it
   - Description: Several participants emphasized that mentoring benefits both mentee and mentor and is part of career development and cultural transmission. Offloading mentoring risks depriving people of growth opportunities and eroding team norms. The feared outcome is atrophying of mentorship skills and reduced opportunities for mentors to learn by teaching. The boundary is that AI should not replace the human practice of mentoring that contributes to individual and organizational learning.
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Mentoring requires empathy. I think these are activities that humans need to do to grow themselves as well (e.g. mentoring someone teaches the mentor as well)."* (Participant 228)  
     - *"I wouldn't want AI to replace the personal aspects of mentoring/onboarding"* (Participant 151)  
     - *"I like to do it and it helps me build a connection with new joinee"* (Participant 333)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Acceptable limited assistance — AI may help but not lead
   - Description: Many participants carve out a middle position: AI can help with documentation, checklists, and answering simple questions, but should not lead mentoring, communicate autonomously on someone’s behalf, or replace human judgement. The concern is misuse through over-automation; the desired condition is human-led workflows where AI is a tool under supervision, with escalation paths for ambiguity. The feared outcome is full autonomy without oversight; the boundary typically invoked is that AI may assist but must not be the final or primary mentor.
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I wouldn't want AI to be entirely autonomous. There should still be varying levels of human oversight depending on the task."* (Participant 204)  
     - *"It could be assisted by AI in some ways, but I wouldn't want it to do the mentoring directly."* (Participant 83)  
     - *"I think its good to have different perspectives and people interactions for mentoring rather than asking for advice from a generic agent."* (Participant 269)  
   - Confidence: High

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections: Participants consistently want AI to remove routine friction (setup, docs, checklists, learning plans, and quick Q&A) so humans can focus on relational, cultural, and judgment-heavy aspects of mentoring. Where AI is welcomed, it is framed as augmentation that reduces mentor workload rather than replacement.
- Tensions: There is a clear tension between efficiency gains and preserving the human elements of mentorship. A minority sees potential for AI to lead or automate mentoring entirely, but most respondents resist that, citing trust, empathy, and identity reasons.
- Conditions/boundaries: Common conditions are (1) human-in-the-loop or clear escalation for uncertain cases, (2) provenance and verifiability of AI outputs, (3) limited autonomy (AI can assist with rote tasks but not perform core mentoring), and (4) explicit preservation of human-to-human onboarding rituals.

### Relation to other tasks
- Some participants contrasted mentoring/onboarding with documentation, troubleshooting, and announcement communication. They more readily accept AI for documentation or announcements but explicitly reject AI as a replacement for the human, cultural work of mentoring and onboarding.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Pro-AI mentors: A few participants (e.g., Participant 7, 23, 318) indicated enthusiasm for AI handling "all aspects" or for AI to take the lead role at times in mentoring and onboarding. These responses contrast strongly with the majority and suggest a small group open to more radical automation.
- Ambivalent respondents: Some entries (e.g., Participant 204, Participant 195) ambiguously praised AI capabilities but insisted on limits such as human oversight — these reflect pragmatic hybrid positions.
- Strict no-AI absolutists: Several respondents rejected any AI role beyond trivial assistance, emphasizing cultural and relational risks. Their stance highlights institutional and ethical resistance that design must address.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

High-level takeaway: Design AI tools for mentoring and onboarding as augmentation-first: automate deterministic, high-volume tasks (setup, docs, learning plans, quick answers) while preserving human ownership of relationship-building, accountability, and final decisions. Emphasize transparency, provenance, easy escalation to humans, and features that encourage—not replace—human mentor interactions.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Onboarding checklist & automation
  - Generate step-by-step, role-specific onboarding checklists (entitlements, repo setup, environment build) with clear success criteria and automated status tracking so mentors and managers can monitor progress.
- Documentation generation with provenance
  - Auto-draft and update onboarding documents and architecture diagrams with cited sources and change history; flag items requiring human validation.
- Personalized learning-plan generator
  - Produce individualized curricula and resource lists that mentors can review and adapt, with suggested milestones and assessment points.
- Interactive Q&A with escalation
  - Provide a conversational assistant that answers common newcomer questions, shows sources/confidence scores, and offers a one-click route to ask a human or schedule a mentor session when confidence is low.
- Human-in-the-loop controls
  - Workflows and UI affordances that make mentor review simple (approve/reject/annotate AI outputs), and governance settings that limit AI autonomy per organization policy.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous replacement of human mentors
  - Do not allow AI to be the default primary mentor or to perform relationship-building tasks without explicit human oversight; avoid automated "welcome" communications that substitute personal introductions.
- Unverified, unsourced recommendations
  - Do not surface AI-generated onboarding steps or technical instructions without provenance and a required human sign-off for critical processes.
- Opaque automated decisions
  - Avoid black-box actions (e.g., automatically changing permissions or pushing config changes) without clear audit trails and human approval.

Design patterns to resolve tensions:
- "Assist then escalate": AI handles first-line, clearly-scoped tasks; when uncertainty or subjective judgement is detected, the system prompts human involvement.
- "Mentor augmentation panel": show AI-suggested onboarding plans and talking points to mentors as draft material, not final content, to preserve mentor agency.
- "Confidence-driven routing": route newcomer questions to AI if confidence > threshold; otherwise, route to a human.

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive onboarding tasks (setup, checklists), documentation generation, and generating learning plans to reduce mentor toil.
- Nearly all participants resist AI replacing the human aspects of mentoring — relationship-building, cultural integration, and personalized judgement.
- Major concerns are hallucinations and the high cost of incorrect mentoring; provenance and human review are essential safeguards.
- Practical middle ground: AI as an assistant (docs, checklists, Q&A, learning-plans) with human-in-the-loop control and clear escalation paths.
- A small minority favors more autonomous AI-led onboarding; design should support configurable autonomy levels but default to human-led workflows.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize AI features that automate deterministic onboarding tasks (entitlements, repo setup, checklists) while preserving human mentorship.  
- Build documentation generators that include citations, editable drafts, and an easy human approval flow.  
- Offer personalized learning-plan templates that mentors can adapt rather than immutable AI prescriptions.  
- Implement conversational Q&A assistants with confidence indicators and one-click escalation to people.  
- Enforce guardrails: no autonomous primary mentoring, require provenance for technical guidance, and keep audit trails to maintain accountability.
