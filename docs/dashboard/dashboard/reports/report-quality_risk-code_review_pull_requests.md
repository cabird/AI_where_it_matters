# Thematic Analysis — Code Review / Pull Requests

I reviewed the participants' paired responses about where they want — and do not want — AI to assist in Code Review and Pull Request (PR) workflows. I focused only on statements explicitly about PRs, code review, related automation (tests, security checks, PR creation), and boundaries around those activities. I grouped recurring ideas into thematic areas, counted participants making relevant remarks, and extracted representative quotes to illustrate the sentiment and rationale.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Automated detection of bugs, security, compliance, and risky changes  
- Description: Participants want AI that scans PRs to surface likely bugs, insecure or non‑compliant code, and high‑risk changes so humans can focus on higher‑level review. The request centers on AI as an early, broad filter that flags problematic areas (security, accessibility, localization, S360 items) and indicates confidence, enabling reviewers to prioritize and reduce manual toil while preserving human judgment for final decisions. Several respondents framed this as a way to reduce human error and to bring consistent checks to every PR.  
- Number of participants: ~30 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"Code review feedback including security and compliance checks. Specifically, accessibility, localization, and security issues."* (Participant 71)  
  - *"I'd like AI to quickly detect security issues or adverse coding patterns, either in PRs or while I'm working."* (Participant 397)  
  - *"Should be able to detect high risk changes & derisk them."* (Participant 45)  
- Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: PR summarization, contextualization, and drafting assistance  
- Description: Developers want AI to condense large diffs, distill complex requests into clear summaries, and draft PR descriptions or even PRs for company‑wide issues. The aim is to speed review cycles and improve reviewer understanding by providing contextual links to internal docs, product info, and conventions. Participants saw this as particularly valuable when working across unfamiliar codebases or when PRs touch many files. The common condition is that the AI should surface context and suggestions — not bypass human review.  
- Number of participants: ~25 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"I find AI is good for scanning and summarizing massive amounts of information... helpful for drafting code in environments with which I am less familiar."* (Participant 20)  
  - *"Distilling complex asks into simpler information. Summarization. Better search and documentation"* (Participant 151)  
  - *"More pull requests to handle companywide issues"* (Participant 23)  
- Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Test generation, refactoring help, and integration support tied to PRs  
- Description: Many participants want AI to generate meaningful unit tests, suggest refactorings, and assist with integration tasks that accompany larger PRs (adding files, updating build, debugging). The motivation is reducing repetitive work and improving coverage, while keeping the developer responsible for validation. Desired outcomes include higher quality tests and smoother multi‑file changes that are reviewable by humans.  
- Number of participants: ~20 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"help with green field projects, help with code reviews, help with writing tests."* (Participant 51)  
  - *"UT refactoring / AI tool specifically for security"* (Participant 314)  
  - *"Automatically review PR and write high quality tests as a pair programmer."* (Participant 283)  
- Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Interactive copilots and configurable agents to automate repetitive PR tasks  
- Description: Developers want side‑by‑side assistants or user‑defined agents that can perform repetitive PR work, offer interactive suggestions during review, and be configured to the team's standards. These agents should speed routine tasks (formatting, checklist verification, triage) and allow engineers to write or tune agents for their workflow. The boundary is clear: agents should require review/confirmation for substantive changes.  
- Number of participants: ~20 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"I hope it can automate pull request... I also want a copilot on the side that help me interactively review PR."* (Participant 114)  
  - *"Individual being able write their own Agents to do repetitive tasks to save time."* (Participant 180)  
  - *"I would love to have an AI programming buddy that can watch as I wrote code and give useful suggestions in real time."* (Participant 213)  
- Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: No final sign‑off, approval, or release‑readiness decisions by AI  
- Description: A strong and recurring boundary is that AI must not make final decisions about code acceptance, release readiness, or risk acceptance. Participants flagged accountability, ethics, and business context as reasons why final judgments must stay human. They want AI to inform and test, but humans to retain responsibility and the authority to accept or reject PRs. This is framed both as an ethical/accountability issue and as a practical safeguard against AI errors.  
- Number of participants: ~40 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle final decision-making in high-stakes risk scenarios..."* (Participant 9)  
  - *"I want to make the final decision about what risks are worth taking"* (Participant 14)  
  - *"I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness or risk acceptance..."* (Participant 241)  
- Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: No automatic code changes, auto‑commits, or direct production edits without human oversight  
- Description: Many participants object to AI making code changes, committing fixes, or touching production systems without explicit human review and approval. The concern is about unintended production impact, loss of control, and extra rework if AI makes incorrect edits. Acceptable behavior is limited to suggested fixes, with humans initiating commits.  
- Number of participants: ~10 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"Automatically change code without user review."* (Participant 21)  
  - *"Directly touching production without oversight"* (Participant 23)  
  - *"Auto commit fixes for S360 item resolution. This may have production user facing implications."* (Participant 410)  
- Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Lack of trust — hallucinations, poor architectural/context understanding, inaccuracies in complex systems  
- Description: Respondents worry that current AI models hallucinate, fail to understand high‑level architecture or integration requirements, and produce incorrect solutions that look plausible. This undermines trust, especially in large or complex codebases where contextual knowledge is critical. The feared outcome is erroneous or brittle code that requires significant developer correction. The boundary is that AI should abstain or explicitly indicate uncertainty when it lacks the context.  
- Number of participants: ~25 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"AI should absolutely not be the determining factor... it frequently hallucinates with absolute certainty..."* (Participant 17)  
  - *"The current models seem to have problems with architectural and software integration problems."* (Participant 47)  
  - *"I don't trust AI for my specific role... I want AI to handle nothing, until it gets significantly better at correctness."* (Participant 53)  
- Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: AI must not absolve human responsibility or replace nuanced human judgment  
- Description: There is an ethical and professional boundary: AI should assist but not relieve engineers of responsibility or replace the nuanced judgment needed for business logic, design choices, or ethical trade‑offs. Participants emphasized that developers must stay accountable and use AI as a tool rather than a decision‑maker, especially for quality and design evaluations.  
- Number of participants: ~20 participants  
- Representative quotes:  
  - *"Should not leave a person absolved of responsibility..."* (Participant 45)  
  - *"At the end of the day, the result is owned by the person who committed and/or signed off on the code generated by an LLM."* (Participant 140)  
  - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle the parts of quality and risk management that involve human judgment, ethical trade‑offs, or team accountability."* (Participant 301)  
- Confidence: High

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections: There is a consistent split between functional expectations and accountability boundaries. Developers welcome AI for repetitive, high‑volume detection (bugs, security, tests, summarization) but insist on human oversight for approval, risk acceptance, or architecture/design decisions. Many want AI to raise issues and suggest fixes but not to act autonomously.
- Tensions: The main contradiction is between those who want aggressive automation ("automate as much as possible", Participant 294; "AI can definitely help in all of them", Participant 299) and those who explicitly distrust current AI for correctness and autonomy. This tension centers on trust: if AI reliability improves, acceptance rises; until then, humans want tight guardrails.
- Conditions/boundaries developers place on AI usage: require explicit human sign‑off for commits or production changes, confidence indicators or a "decline to answer" when uncertain, audit trails for AI suggestions/changes, speed/performance constraints (AI must be fast), and avoidance of "auto‑approve" or "auto‑commit" defaults.
  
Relation to other tasks
- Participants contrasted PR review with testing, debugging, and test generation: many see AI as more suitable for generating and running tests or debugging assistance than for final code acceptance. Several specifically requested that AI help write tests and run them as part of PR checks.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full automation advocates: A few participants asserted broad confidence in AI's capabilities and asked for end‑to‑end automation (e.g., Participant 330, Participant 299). These are outliers relative to the dominant cautious stance.
- Extreme distrust: A small group wants no AI involvement until proven superior to humans (Participant 145, Participant 53). Their position highlights the need for measured pilots and evidence of correctness.
- "Knock yourself out" stance: One participant (62) welcomed broad AI activity and said they would personally filter AI feedback, indicating some developers will act as manual backstops rather than relying on system guardrails.
- Context‑sensitive automation: Some participants asked for AI that can add files and perform repository integrations (Participant 103) — this is higher‑trust automation in a narrow, controlled scope and indicates a potential safe path for limited autonomy when robust integration checks exist.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

AI tools for PRs should prioritize augmentation, transparency, and human-in-the-loop controls. They must provide clear signals about confidence and limitations, and default to suggestion rather than action.

Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Contextual analysis and cross‑repo awareness
  - Capability: Access and reason over relevant internal docs, standards, and code context to reduce false positives and provide accurate suggestions. Rationale: Multiple participants requested better contextual relevance to avoid off‑base suggestions.
- Security and compliance scanners integrated into PR flow
  - Capability: Automated checks for security, accessibility, localization, and S360 items with actionable remediation suggestions. Rationale: Clear demand for consistent, early detection of risky code.
- Test generation and PR‑level test harnessing
  - Capability: Suggest and generate unit tests and refactorings, optionally run test suites or annotate test coverage impacts in PRs. Rationale: Participants wanted AI to reduce manual test work and improve quality.
- Confidence scores, abstain/decline behavior, and traceable rationale
  - Capability: Each suggestion should include a confidence level and short explanation; the model should explicitly decline when uncertain. Rationale: Builds trust and allows reviewers to calibrate attention.
- Human‑in‑the‑loop controls and safe defaults
  - Capability: No auto‑commits or auto‑deploy by default; require explicit user approval for commits, and provide undo/trace/change logs. Rationale: Strong participant insistence on human finality and accountability.
- Interactive copilot and configurable agents
  - Capability: Side‑panel copilot for summarization, comment drafting, and configurable agents for repetitive tasks that teams can tune. Rationale: Participants asked for interactive, configurable help that fits team workflows.

Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Auto‑committing or auto‑deploying code without explicit human approval
  - Rationale: Directly touching production was repeatedly flagged as unacceptable.
- Treating AI as sole decision‑maker for architecture, business logic, or release readiness
  - Rationale: Participants emphasized human accountability and nuance for complex decisions.
- Silent hallucinations or opaque suggestions
  - Rationale: Hallucinated outputs that look authoritative erode trust; model must flag uncertainty.
- Overly verbose default logic that hides maintainability concerns
  - Rationale: Participants worried about AI producing brittle or monolithic solutions that hurt long‑term maintainability.

Design patterns to resolve tensions
- Staged automation: allow suggestions → review → approve → apply, with granular gating at each step.
- Confidence‑based triage: surface high‑confidence, low‑risk fixes for quick reviewer attention; low‑confidence findings are presented as speculative with references.
- Role‑based policies: teams can configure what categories of PR changes AI may auto‑apply (e.g., style fixes) and which always require manual approval (e.g., security fixes).
- Audit trails and explainability: every AI suggestion should be traceable to code locations and rationale to enable fast human verification.

## Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize AI features that detect bugs, security issues, and risky changes in PRs while providing clear confidence indicators.  
- Build PR summarization and contextual lookup (internal docs, conventions) to reduce reviewer cognitive load.  
- Offer test generation and integration assistance but require human sign‑off before any commits or production changes.  
- Default to human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, with explicit abstain/uncertainty behaviors to prevent hallucinated fixes.  
- Provide configuration and auditability so teams control what AI can do and maintain accountability.

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI to flag bugs, security/compliance issues, and risky changes in PRs, reducing manual triage.  
- Summarization and context enrichment (diff summaries, internal docs) are high‑value; AI should help reviewers understand large PRs.  
- AI test generation and integration assistance are desired but must be reviewable and validated by humans.  
- Strong consensus: AI must not perform final sign‑offs, approve releases, or auto‑commit substantive changes without explicit human approval.  
- Major trust concerns center on hallucinations and poor architectural/context awareness; tools must show confidence and abstain when uncertain.  
- Design must enforce human accountability (audit trails, explicit approvals) and provide configurable, staged automation to balance speed and safety.
