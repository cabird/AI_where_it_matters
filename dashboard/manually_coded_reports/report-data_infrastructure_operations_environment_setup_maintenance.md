This report synthesizes manually coded survey responses from software developers about AI usage in Environment Setup Maintenance (Infrastructure Operations). I preserved the research team's exact themes, codes, and descriptions, and integrated participant quotes (PID identifiers) into analytic narratives that surface motivations, concerns, and design implications. Participant counts are reported as unique PIDs rounded to the nearest 5 as requested; confidence labels use the underlying participant counts to indicate how broadly a theme is represented.

## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Automated provisioning, configuration, upgrades & migrations

Participants express a clear desire for AI to handle end-to-end environment lifecycle tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, and prerequisite to development work. The core expectation is that AI can "stand up environments end-to-end, apply configs/upgrades, migrate infra, and handle routine maintenance" so engineers do not expend cycles on setup. Responses emphasize both breadth (setup, maintenance, monitoring) and depth (migrations and upgrades) — participants imagine AI orchestrating the heavy lifting across these phases to free engineers for higher-value work. For example, one participant summarized this by asking for AI that could do "all infra setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance, and monitoring and alerting" (PID168).

At the same time, the desired outcome is operational reliability: respondents want automation that reduces manual effort and the cognitive load of managing prerequisites for day-to-day development. One participant framed this as not wanting to "do all the setup and tedious things that are not really a part of my day-to-day job but are pre-requisites for everything I do" (PID170). Boundaries are implicit: automation should reliably perform the full lifecycle tasks without creating additional unexpected work.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Automated provisioning, configuration, upgrades & migrations**: Stand up environments end-to-end, apply configs/upgrades, migrate infra, and handle routine maintenance so engineers don’t burn cycles on setup prerequisites.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 6)

Representative quotes:
- "If AI can do all infra setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance, and monitoring and alerting, that would be great." (Participant PID168)
- "Setting up infra, migrating infra, maintaining/updating infra." (Participant PID3)
- "Automating infrastructure configurations and environment setups and upgrades" (Participant PID264)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Reduce setup toil

Respondents repeatedly frame environment setup as "toil" — the repetitive, low-value, error-prone work that consumes developer hours. The reasoning is pragmatic: reduce the hours spent rebuilding or wiring environments and remove long manual processes so teams can focus on development and testing. One participant expects AI to "reduce hours spent (re)building environments" and "reduce toil hours spent for monitoring/alerting" (PID2), while another simply asks to "remove long manual processes" (PID108). The motivation is time savings and mental overhead reduction rather than creating novel capabilities.

Participants implied conditions: the automation should be reliable and actually reduce manual iterations rather than shifting the burden (e.g., by producing brittle scripts). The goal is smoother, faster setup with fewer interruptions to engineering flow.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Reduce setup toil **: Shrink the hours spent rebuilding or wiring environments; automate the boring glue work around setup.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 3)

Representative quotes:
- "reduction in hours spent (re)building environments. reduction on toil hours spent for monitoring/alerting." (Participant PID2)
- "Remove long manual processes" (Participant PID108)
- "Hopefully it can automate the boring things" (Participant PID262)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Cross-OS compatibility & script assistance

Some respondents want AI to solve practical compatibility headaches during setup by generating scripts that "just work" across common Unix variants and distributions. The central need is pragmatic: create setup scripts that handle differences between macOS, Ubuntu, CentOS, Azure Linux, etc., reducing trial-and-error across developer machines and CI environments. The quote reflects this: "to be able to make bash scripts which are compatible with different unix os like osx, ubuntu or centos, azurelinux etc." (PID161).

This is a focused, technical ask — not about full autonomy but about smarter, context-aware script generation that anticipates OS differences and minimizes manual fixes. Participants expect the AI to be competent in common shell ecosystems and produce robust, portable scripts.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Cross-OS compatibility & script assistance**: Generate/setup scripts that “just work” across macOS/Linux variants and common distros during env setup.

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "to be able to make bash scripts which are compatible with different unix os like osx, ubuntu or centos, azurelinux etc." (Participant PID161)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Toil

This theme reiterates the broader desire to remove repetitive, manual effort from environment setup and monitoring workflows. Respondents describe a fragmented AI experience today — several AI capabilities can make pieces of the task easier, but they still end up performing repetitive steps "separately repeatedly," which preserves tedium. One respondent observed, "We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work. The items are generally interrelated, but we currently need to use AI to solve them separately repeatedly" (PID269). Others emphasize the same thread: they want the "boring" work automated and fewer interruptions for mundane setup tasks (PIDs PID2, PID108, PID170, PID262).

The desired outcome is an integrated automation layer that eliminates repetitive context-switching and reduces rebuild time. Participants want AI that coalesces the many small automations into fewer, reliable end-to-end flows.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Toil**: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 5)

Representative quotes:
- "reduction in hours spent (re)building environments. reduction on toil hours spent for monitoring/alerting." (Participant PID2)
- "I don't want to have to do all the setup and tedious things that are not really a part of my day-to-day job but are pre-requisites for everything I do." (Participant PID170)
- "We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work... we currently need to use AI to solve them separately repeatedly which makes the tasks easier but still tedious." (Participant PID269)

Confidence: Medium

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Quality and trust concerns

Participants warn that environment setup and maintenance demand reliability and determinism; they are reluctant to hand these responsibilities to probabilistic ML systems unless those systems can prove correctness. The coded description captures this: "Env setup must be deterministic, precise, and verifiably correct. Until AI shows contextual understanding and can measure correctness of its changes, keep humans in control (prefer deterministic automation over ML where precision is required)." A representative participant emphasized that environment setup "needs to be reliable and fully deterministic" (PID159).

The concern is practical: misapplied changes or incomplete contextual understanding can break environments or introduce subtle configuration drift. One participant argued that ML is "not perfect" and that for operations needing precision, "it is better to automate using traditional programming" (PID195). Another stressed waiting until AI can judge whether “it’s updating the Environment correctly with enough context available” (PID209). The boundary is clear: use ML where tolerance for imperfection exists; prefer deterministic automation or human oversight for critical environment changes.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Quality and trust concerns**: Env setup must be deterministic, precise, and verifiably correct. Until AI shows contextual understanding and can measure correctness of its changes, keep humans in control (prefer deterministic automation over ML where precision is required).

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 3)

Representative quotes:
- "Environment setup and maintenance, because this needs to be reliable and fully deterministic" (Participant PID159)
- "ML is not perfect; it is best used where algorithms are not available/feasible to implement. For operations that needs to be precise, it is better to automate using traditional programming." (Participant PID195)
- "Environment setup until we have a contextual understanding or correctness measured by AI properly and be able to judge if its updating the Environment correctly with enough context available." (Participant PID209)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Security-critical changes & access controls are off-limits

A strong, single-threaded concern is that AI should not be authorized to make security-critical infrastructure changes or alter access controls. The coded description states this plainly: "Don’t hand AI critical infra changes, security configurations, or permissions—blast radius is too large (outages/security risks)." One participant put it succinctly: "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls, as mistakes in these areas could cause serious outages or security risks." (PID284).

This is a strict boundary: even if AI can automate routine setup, control-plane or privilege-related actions are sensitive and should remain constrained. Participants worry about both accidental misconfiguration and potential exploit vectors if AI has elevated privileges.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Security-critical changes & access controls are off-limits**: Don’t hand AI critical infra changes, security configurations, or permissions—blast radius is too large (outages/security risks).

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls, as mistakes in these areas could cause serious outages or security risks." (Participant PID284)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Determinism

Respondents singled out determinism as essential for environment setup: the process must be reliable and reproducible. The coded description reiterates this: (no new description beyond the code). The key quote captures the core worry: "Environment setup and maintenance, because this needs to be reliable and fully deterministic" (PID159). Determinism is presented as a requirement for trust and for choosing automation approaches — deterministic scripts or infrastructure-as-code are preferred over opaque probabilistic methods unless the latter can guarantee repeatability.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Determinism**: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "Environment setup and maintenance, because this needs to be reliable and fully deterministic" (Participant PID159)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Accuracy

Participants emphasize that inaccuracies are costly in infra operations and argue that ML should not replace precise algorithmic automation where the cost of error is high. The coded description is contained in the quote: "ML is not perfect; it is best used where algorithms are not available/feasible to implement. For operations that needs to be precise, it is better to automate using traditional programming." (PID195). The implication is that AI can assist in mundane or heuristic tasks, but when exactness matters (configuration values, stateful migrations), deterministic solutions or human verification must prevail.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Accuracy**: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "ML is not perfect; it is best used where algorithms are not available/feasible to implement." (Participant PID195)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Context

A recurring technical caution is that environment setup often requires rich, local context (existing configs, network topology, implicit conventions) that AI may not reliably capture. The code description addresses context limitations: AI should not modify environments until it can demonstrate contextual understanding and measure correctness. One participant said explicitly: "Environment setup until we have a contextual understanding or correctness measured by AI properly and be able to judge if its updating the Environment correctly with enough context available." (PID209). Participants worry about partial or out-of-date views leading to unsafe or incorrect changes.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Context**: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "Environment setup until we have a contextual understanding or correctness measured by AI properly..." (Participant PID209)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Security

Security appears twice as a concern (both a theme and as part of the "off-limits" theme), underscoring its salience. The coded description (no additional text) and quote highlight that security-related tasks should remain protected from autonomous AI actions: "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls..." (PID284). This repeats and reinforces a strict boundary: anything with potential to impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability should have human oversight.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Security**: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~0 participants (actual unique PIDs: 1)

Representative quotes:
- "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls..." (Participant PID284)

Confidence: Low

---

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to eliminate repetitive, time-consuming setup tasks (provisioning, upgrades, cross-OS scripting) but are simultaneously wary of giving AI unchecked control over deterministic, security-sensitive operations. The "want" themes focus on reducing toil and automating routine flows; the "don't want" themes insist those automations be precise, verifiable, and bounded.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Participants are comfortable delegating repetitive, low-risk tasks (script generation, wiring, rebuilds) but demand human control, verifiability, or deterministic mechanisms for high-risk operations (migrations, security config, finalizing changes). Conditions include demonstrable determinism, correctness checks, and limited permission scope.

- Task-specific nuances: Environment setup is unique because it couples stateful infrastructure (which can be fragile) with a high cost of error. Setup tasks often require local, historical, or environmental context (existing configs, developer machine diversity, CI state), which constrains purely generative models unless they can access and reason about that context reliably.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is built on reproducibility and verifiability, not on the mere ability to produce plausible outputs. Developers prefer deterministic automation (scripts, IaC) where possible and see AI as most valuable when it augments those deterministic flows (e.g., generating idempotent IaC templates, cross-platform scripts, or suggested runbooks) rather than replacing them. Human-in-the-loop guardrails are essential for high-impact changes.

---

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives: A few participants (e.g., PID161) focus narrowly on cross-OS script portability — an engineering pain point that may not be top-of-mind for others but is high value in heterogeneous teams.

- Unique insights: PID269’s comment about the need for a "more cohesive AI experience" highlights a gap: multiple partial AI solutions exist, but they do not combine into smooth end-to-end automation. This suggests integration and orchestration is itself a design problem.

- Ambivalent responses: Some participants simultaneously express enthusiasm for automation and caution about precision; e.g., PID209 appears in both “want” and “quality/trust” clusters, expressing desire for automation but insisting on contextual correctness before full trust.

- Contradictions within individuals: There is implicit tension where participants want AI to remove toil but also insist on deterministic correctness; resolving this requires designs that produce deterministic artifacts (scripts/IaC) from AI suggestions or that require human verification before execution.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Overall, developers want AI to eliminate repetitive setup work, generate robust cross-platform scripts, and orchestrate end-to-end environment flows — but only within strict boundaries that preserve determinism, correctness, and security. AI tools should therefore prioritize producing verifiable, idempotent artifacts, enable transparent review workflows, and limit direct access to critical control planes.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **End-to-end provisioning orchestration**
  - Capability: Generate and orchestrate full environment lifecycles (provision → configure → upgrade → migrate) with clear logs and rollback paths.
  - Rationale: Participants want AI to "stand up environments end-to-end" and handle migrations and maintenance (PID3, PID168).
  - Example: "Setting up infra, migrating infra, maintaining/updating infra." (PID3)

- **Toil reduction / task automation**
  - Capability: Automate repetitive build/wiring tasks and monitoring setup to reduce hours spent rebuilding environments.
  - Rationale: Minimizing manual rebuilds and long manual processes is a primary motivation (PID2, PID108, PID262).
  - Example: "reduction in hours spent (re)building environments." (PID2)

- **Cross-OS script generation with robust portability**
  - Capability: Produce portable, idempotent scripts and IaC that adapt to OS/distro differences and include detection/guard clauses.
  - Rationale: Developers explicitly requested help making bash scripts compatible across macOS, Ubuntu, CentOS, AzureLinux, etc. (PID161).
  - Example: "to be able to make bash scripts which are compatible with different unix os..." (PID161)

- **Transparent, verifiable outputs (deterministic artifacts)**
  - Capability: Output deterministic artifacts (IaC templates, checked scripts, testable manifests) rather than opaque one-off changes; include explainability and diffable changes.
  - Rationale: Participants demand determinism and prefer algorithmic automation for precision-sensitive operations (PID159, PID195).
  - Example: "Environment setup and maintenance... needs to be reliable and fully deterministic" (PID159)

- **Integrated human-in-the-loop workflows**
  - Capability: Provide suggested changes with clear approvals, dry-runs, and automated validation checks before any execution in production-like environments.
  - Rationale: Conditional acceptance requires human oversight for high-risk changes, especially security or access control alterations (PID209, PID284).
  - Example: "Environment setup until we have a contextual understanding... be able to judge if its updating the Environment correctly" (PID209)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous security and access control changes**
  - Risk: Unauthorized or erroneous privilege/configuration changes can cause outages or security breaches.
  - Rationale: Participants explicitly disallow AI to handle critical infra changes, security configurations, or access controls (PID284).
  - Quote: "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls..." (PID284)

- **Opaque, non-deterministic apply actions without verification**
  - Risk: ML-driven changes applied without deterministic outputs or verification can introduce drift and unpredictable failures.
  - Rationale: Environment setup requires "reliable and fully deterministic" behavior; ML should not replace deterministic automation where precision is required (PID159, PID195).
  - Quote: "ML is not perfect... it is better to automate using traditional programming." (PID195)

- **Tools that fragment rather than integrate**
  - Risk: Multiple narrow AI tools that do parts of setup but don't coordinate leave users stitching together solutions, preserving toil (PID269).
  - Rationale: Participants want a cohesive AI experience rather than many disconnected helpers.
  - Quote: "We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work... we currently need to use AI to solve them separately repeatedly..." (PID269)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop orchestration: AI generates deterministic artifacts (IaC, scripts) and test plans; humans review diffs and approve automatic execution in staging before production. This satisfies desire for automation while preserving determinism and control.

- Constrained capability tokens: Separate the ability to propose changes from the ability to execute them. AI can author changes and simulate outcomes but requires separate elevated approvals or short-lived credentials for any high-impact operations (addresses PID284).

- Explainable transforms and validation harnesses: Require AI to produce a concise, testable checklist (preconditions, postconditions, rollback steps) and run automated validation in an isolated environment before permitting real-world application (addresses PID159, PID209).

- Integrated orchestration layer: Bundle AI assistants into a single orchestration platform that composes script generation, provisioning, and monitoring setup end-to-end to avoid fragmented workflows (responds to PID269).

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to remove repetitive environment setup and maintenance tasks (provisioning, upgrades, migrations) so they can focus on core development work.
- They want help reducing "toil" (hours rebuilding/wiring environments) and generating cross-OS compatible scripts that just work across developer machines and CI.
- At the same time, developers resist handing AI control over security-critical changes, access controls, or any non-deterministic changes without verifiable correctness.
- Critical design implications: AI must produce deterministic, verifiable artifacts (IaC, scripts, diffs), support human-in-the-loop approvals, and integrate end-to-end rather than fragment workflows.
- Notable tension: Desire for automation versus need for precision and contextual correctness — resolved best by AI that suggests deterministic changes and requires validation/approval before execution.
- Forward-looking recommendation: Build AI tooling that outputs idempotent, testable artifacts, runs automated validations, and enforces strict permission separation for any execution that affects production or security settings.
