## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Telemetry-driven anomaly detection, root cause analysis & failure prediction
Participants want AI that continuously mines telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) and historical incident data to surface anomalies early, predict failures, and accelerate root-cause analysis and mitigation. The researcher-provided description captures this: “Continuously mine logs/metrics/traces and history to detect anomalies early, predict failures, and accelerate root-cause analysis and mitigation.” Respondents envision AI that automates repetitive investigative queries, highlights unusual dashboard signals, and suggests likely causal chains so humans can act faster and more proactively. Several participants framed this in terms of reducing manual intervention and moving from reactive firefighting to proactive remediation: “Automating queries in logs, making alarms smarter, reducing manual intervention by getting to root cause faster” (Participant 80). Participants also described a desire for AI to synthesize the health of diverse services and flag deviations to focus engineering effort: “Determining through observability the state and health of all our services… and surface any anomalies that we can focus on addressing” (Participant 183). Boundaries mentioned include ensuring the AI’s suggestions are trustworthy and explainable so humans can validate automated inferences.

Sub-themes identified:
- Telemetry-driven anomaly detection, root cause analysis & failure prediction: Continuously mine logs/metrics/traces and history to detect anomalies early, predict failures, and accelerate root-cause analysis and mitigation.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (counted unique PIDs: 11; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Alert and error triage. Finding root causes." (Participant 50)
- "I would like AI analysis of metrics and logs to accelerate root cause analysis of incidents, highlighting interesting things in dashboards…" (Participant 54)
- "AI should constantly analyzes logs, metrics, and system behavior to identify deviations and predict potential failures…" (Participant 309)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: Alert triage & incident response automation
Participants want AI to reduce on-call load by triaging alerts, enriching context, routing/escalating, and triggering playbooks—while keeping humans in the loop for final decisions. The code’s description captures this: “Cut on-call load by responding to alerts, enriching context, routing/escalating, and kicking off playbooks—while keeping humans in the loop.” Respondents imagine AI performing the tedious first steps of incident response (gathering logs, summarizing impact, filling templates) and optionally initiating known remediations for low-risk issues. The motivation is both to accelerate time-to-resolution and to reduce cognitive load for responders: “Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call” (Participant 14). Participants also want AI to create artifacts like incident records automatically: “I would like it to set up templates for created IcMs.” (Participant 200). Conditions include preserving human oversight on novel or high-risk incidents.

Sub-themes identified:
- Alert triage & incident response automation: Cut on-call load by responding to alerts, enriching context, routing/escalating, and kicking off playbooks—while keeping humans in the loop.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 5; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call" (Participant 14)
- "Handling incident response and enrichment better" (Participant 90)
- "Pro active alert monitoring, triage, escalation and remediation of known issues and security concerns" (Participant 362)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Infra-aware monitoring setup & smart alerting
Developers expect AI to understand infrastructure-as-code and system topology to auto-configure monitoring and reduce alert noise. The code description captures this desire: “Understand infra code/topology to auto-configure monitors and custom alerts; leverage history and dependencies to reduce noise and improve coverage.” Participants imagine an AI that reads infra definitions, suggests meaningful monitors, and reuses historical incident patterns to suggest which alerts matter and how to tune thresholds: “Custom monitoring and alerts without having to think about it… For copilot to read our ev2 and know how our infra is setup would be insane.” (Participant 123). They also see value in a cohesive AI experience that links related infra tasks rather than forcing repeated, disconnected interventions: “We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work. The items are generally interrelated…” (Participant 269). Desired outcomes are better coverage, fewer false positives, and faster setup—while keeping control of critical decisions.

Sub-themes identified:
- Infra-aware monitoring setup & smart alerting: Understand infra code/topology to auto-configure monitors and custom alerts; leverage history and dependencies to reduce noise and improve coverage.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (counted unique PIDs: 8; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Custom monitoring and alerts without having to think about it. being able to setup after 'understanding' our infra from our infra code." (Participant 123)
- "Monitoring production is a big one, can alert on conditions that a human would have trouble setting up on their own" (Participant 173)
- "AI is really well suited … setting and firing up alerts based on previous history of incidents." (Participant 271)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Auto system health checks
AI is expected to reduce routine maintenance toil through automated health checks and safe remediation of common issues. The code states: “Reduce manual monitoring toil and keep systems healthy; where safe, remediate known issues automatically and maintain environments.” Respondents want automation for environment setup, maintenance, and self-healing so teams can focus on new features: “reduction in hours spent (re)building environments. reduction on toil hours spent for monitoring/alerting.” (Participant 2). They also expressed hope that AI would keep “the lights” on as engineers move between projects: “AI should help in maintenance of services, making sure that the lights are kept on when the developers move on to new features” (Participant 261). Important boundaries include limiting autonomous remediation to well-understood, reversible fixes.

Sub-themes identified:
- Auto system health checks: Reduce manual monitoring toil and keep systems healthy; where safe, remediate known issues automatically and maintain environments.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 7; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Monitoring and self healing." (Participant 19)
- "If AI can do all infra setup, troubleshooting, and maintenance, and monitoring and alerting, that would be great." (Participant 168)
- "AI should help in maintenance of services, making sure that the lights are kept on…" (Participant 261)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Toil
Several responses emphasize that AI should remove repetitive, boring operational tasks and glue together interrelated infra activities to reduce manual repetition. The researchers labeled this “Toil” and included comments about reducing time spent rebuilding environments and avoiding repeated, separate AI workflows for related tasks. The outcome sought is a cohesive automation layer that eliminates tedious steps: “Hopefully it can automate the boring things” (Participant 262). Participants also noted that current AI workflows sometimes solve individual tasks but leave the larger, interrelated workload still tedious: “We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work… which makes the tasks easier but still tedious.” (Participant 269).

Sub-themes identified:
- Toil: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 3; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:

- "Hopefully it can automate the boring things" (Participant 262)
- "We need a more cohesive AI experience for Infra related work." (Participant 269)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: Automate alerts
Participants explicitly want AI to take on alert handling to reduce human on-call burden—though typically with human oversight in critical scenarios. The code and short quote capture the primary desire: “Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call” (Participant 14). The context is reducing interrupt-driven toil and enabling responders to concentrate on complex incidents.

Sub-themes identified:
- Automate alerts: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call" (Participant 14)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: AI for learning
Some participants want AI to augment human learning and not supplant it—AI should accelerate engineer skill development while keeping humans central. The coded description states: “AI to enhance human engineer's ability WHILE increasing the rate at which human engineers learn and develop.” One participant emphasized that AI should not be a crutch that prevents engineers from gaining the intuition needed for complex operational reasoning: “The human should always be paramount, and AI should be a tool to enhance what humans can understand and apply to their work, not a crutch…” (Participant 16).

Sub-themes identified:
- AI for learning: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I want AI to enhance human engineer's ability WHILE increasing the rate at which human engineers learn and develop." (Participant 16)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Root cause
Closely related to telemetry-driven detection, participants explicitly asked for faster root-cause discovery via AI-assisted log and metric analysis. The code description highlights “Finding root causes.” Respondents see AI helping automate queries and identify the most relevant signals to explain failures: “Finding root causes” (Participant 50); “making alarms smarter, reducing manual intervention by getting to root cause faster” (Participant 80). Desired outcomes are reduced MTTR and earlier detection of latent issues.

Sub-themes identified:
- Root cause: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 4; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Alert and error triage. Finding root causes." (Participant 50)
- "I would like AI analysis of metrics and logs to accelerate root cause analysis of incidents…" (Participant 54)
- "Automating queries in logs, making alarms smarter…" (Participant 80)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Security (Want)
Some participants named security-related monitoring as a useful AI target—e.g., automated detection of SFI (suspicious/fraud/intrusion) events—in the same breath as operational monitoring. The code stands for security use-cases within monitoring: “SFI, SFI, SFI, and how about SFI!!!” (Participant 109). This suggests interest in AI-enhanced detection of security anomalies alongside system health alerts.

Sub-themes identified:
- Security: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "SFI, SFI, SFI, and how about SFI!!!" (Participant 109)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Automate monitoring
Participants asked for AI that can auto-configure monitoring and alerts based on understanding infrastructure and past incidents—overlapping with infra-aware setup and telemetry themes. The code states: “Custom monitoring and alerts without having to think about it… it could help debug production incidents as well.” The motivation is to remove the expertise barrier for setting effective monitors and to scale monitoring coverage.

Sub-themes identified:
- Automate monitoring: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 5; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Custom monitoring and alerts without having to think about it…" (Participant 123)
- "Monitoring production is a big one, can alert on conditions that a human would have trouble setting up on their own" (Participant 173)
- "AI is really well suited… setting and firing up alerts based on previous history…" (Participant 271)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Knowledge synthesis
Participants want AI to collect and synthesize information across components during incidents to present actionable suggestions. The code description captures this: “collect information from different component and help me understand the live incident, and give me some suggestions” (Participant 246). The value is fast situational awareness and prioritized next steps.

Sub-themes identified:
- Knowledge synthesis: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "collect information from different component and help me understand the live incident, and give me some suggestions" (Participant 246)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Toil (maintenance)
Closely aligned with Auto system health checks and Toil, this theme emphasizes maintenance automation to keep services running without constant manual intervention: “AI should help in maintenance of services, making sure that the lights are kept on when the developers move on to new features” (Participant 261). The expectation is long-term operational resilience with minimal human maintenance overhead.

Sub-themes identified:
- Toil (maintenance): (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "AI should help in maintenance of services, making sure that the lights are kept on…" (Participant 261)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Predict failures
Participants want predictive monitoring so issues are caught before impacting users, leveraging telemetry and behavior patterns. The code reiterates: “AI should constantly analyzes logs, metrics, and system behavior to identify deviations and predict potential failures…” (Participant 309). This is framed as an essential shift from reactive to proactive operations.

Sub-themes identified:
- Predict failures: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 2; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "AI should constantly analyzes logs, metrics, and system behavior to identify deviations and predict potential failures…" (Participant 309)
- "I’d like AI to help automate root cause analysis and anomaly detection across our infrastructure…" (Participant 355)

Confidence: Low

---

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: No unsupervised control of production or critical actions
Respondents strongly resisted granting AI unsupervised authority over production systems or critical actions. The researchers’ description is explicit: “Final authority stays with humans for prod touches, emergency overrides, and critical infra changes; no autonomous actions.” Participants stressed the high cost of mistakes and demanded human oversight for any critical mitigation: “For critical actions, I would not like AI to take actions on it's own… a mistake… can cause heavy downtime” (Participant 271). Some called out specific domains where autonomy is unacceptable, such as emergency responses and critical overrides: “I wouldn’t want AI to handle emergency response decisions or critical system overrides…” (Participant 331).

Sub-themes identified:
- No unsupervised control of production or critical actions: Final authority stays with humans for prod touches, emergency overrides, and critical infra changes; no autonomous actions.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 4; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Probably direct touches to production systems" (Participant 123)
- "Critical customer facing infra shouldn't be handled for safety concerns" (Participant 130)
- "I wouldn’t want AI to handle emergency response decisions or critical system overrides…" (Participant 331)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Security, secrets & permissions are off-limits
Participants drew a firm boundary around secrets, access controls, and privileged changes: these should not be delegated to AI. The code captures the concern: “Don’t delegate secrets management, access controls, or highly secure features to AI; risk and policy constraints dominate.” Examples included keyvault/secret management and permissions: “Secret/keyvault management” (Participant 234); “Anything regarding permissions to developers and customers should be off-limit for AI. We do not want Skynet to exist.” (Participant 371). The rationale is clear: legal, compliance, and security risks make these areas unsuitable for AI control.

Sub-themes identified:
- Security, secrets & permissions are off-limits: Don’t delegate secrets management, access controls, or highly secure features to AI; risk and policy constraints dominate.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 4; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Secret/keyvault management" (Participant 234)
- "I don't want AI to handle critical infrastructure changes, security configurations, or access controls…" (Participant 284)
- "Anything regarding permissions to developers and customers should be off-limit for AI." (Participant 371)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Reliability & precision constraints (trust boundary)
Respondents emphasized that AI should not be used where precision or determinism is required unless the model is demonstrably reliable; deterministic automation preferred for high-stakes tasks. The code describes this: “If precision is required or the cost of error is high, don’t use AI unless it’s demonstrably reliable; favor deterministic automation and exhaustive final checks.” Participants warned against substituting ML for deterministic logic in areas that can be precisely coded: “For operations that needs to be precise, it is better to automate using traditional programming.” (Participant 195). They also demanded extensive final checks: “Final checks might need to be more brute force and test everything to make sure that AI doesn't do mistakes.” (Participant 262).

Sub-themes identified:
- Reliability & precision constraints (trust boundary): If precision is required or the cost of error is high, don’t use AI unless it’s demonstrably reliable; favor deterministic automation and exhaustive final checks.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 4; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Any activity which cannot be fully and reliably handled by AI should not be done by AI." (Participant 44)
- "For operations that needs to be precise, it is better to automate using traditional programming." (Participant 195)
- "Final checks might need to be more brute force and test everything…" (Participant 262)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Human judgment and intuition is central
Several respondents insisted that live incident sense-making and operational intuition must remain human-led; AI may assist but should not replace human reasoning especially in complex, context-rich incidents. The code captures this: “Live incident sense-making across multiple sources and the development of operational intuition should remain human-led; AI assists, not replaces.” Participants argued that environments differ and engineers need to learn patterns to handle novel problems: “Reasoning and decision making while navigating through a complex workflow… analyzing a livesite and root causing while referring multiple sources of information.” (Participant 29). They cautioned that over-reliance on AI could stunt learning and leave teams unprepared for high-severity events.

Sub-themes identified:
- Human judgment and intuition is central: Live incident sense-making across multiple sources and the development of operational intuition should remain human-led; AI assists, not replaces.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 2; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Reasoning and decision making while navigating through a complex workflow…" (Participant 29)
- "I want AI to guide and assist human engineer development, not replace lower experience engineers…" (Participant 16)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: No AI
At least one respondent expressed blanket skepticism about AI adoption in operations, questioning organizational enthusiasm despite AI failures. The code conveys outright rejection in some cases: “Managers are happy to fire an employee that doesn't learn from their mistakes… but everybody seems happy to keep pushing AI despite the same failures.” (Participant 145). This reflects distrust in current AI reliability and managerial incentives.

Sub-themes identified:
- No AI: (Description provided by researchers)

#### Theme: Privacy
Privacy and secret-handling surfaced as a specific concern—participants flagged secret/keyvault management as inappropriate for AI handling. The code reiterates: “Secret/keyvault management” (Participant 234).

Sub-themes identified:
- Privacy: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "Secret/keyvault management" (Participant 234)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Human oversight
Participants repeatedly demanded human oversight for critical actions and for permission-sensitive operations. The code description: “Human oversight” was emphasized: “For critical actions, I would not like AI to take actions on it's own… we would like to oversee or conduct mitigation actions on our own.” (Participant 271). This highlights a general preference for human-in-the-loop workflows.

Sub-themes identified:
- Human oversight: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 2; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "For critical actions, I would not like AI to take actions on it's own." (Participant 271)
- "Anything regarding permissions to developers and customers should be off-limit for AI." (Participant 371)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Business context
Some participants emphasized that business context and accountability make certain emergency or override decisions unsuitable for AI alone. The code captures this: “Those situations demand human judgment, situational awareness, and accountability that AI isn’t equipped to fully manage.” (Participant 331).

Sub-themes identified:
- Business context: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "I wouldn’t want AI to handle emergency response decisions or critical system overrides… those situations demand human judgment…" (Participant 331)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Security (Dont want AI)
Participants repeated security concerns specifically in the “don’t delegate to AI” context: “highly secure feature are maybe not foreseen to transfer through AI tools” (Participant 348). This reinforces the off-limits boundary around security-sensitive operations.

Sub-themes identified:
- Security: (Description provided by researchers)

Number of participants: ~5 participants (counted unique PIDs: 1; rounded to nearest 5)

Representative quotes:
- "don’t know if there is any but highly secure feature are maybe not foreseen to transfer through AI tools" (Participant 348)

Confidence: Low

---

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: The data shows a clear complementarity between capabilities developers want (telemetry-driven detection, triage automation, infra-aware alerting, self-healing) and strong restrictions on autonomy (no unsupervised production control, secrets off-limits). Developers want AI to automate repetitive analysis and setup while retaining human authority over high-stakes actions. This creates a tight coupling: AI for detection/recommendation versus humans for final decision and accountability.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is highly conditional. Respondents repeatedly specified boundaries—human-in-the-loop for critical changes, deterministic automation for precision tasks, and exclusion of secrets/permissions. Trust depends on predictability, reversibility, and explainability; AI suggestions are acceptable, autonomous actions are not unless the scope is trivial, reversible, and well-tested.

- Task-specific nuances: Infrastructure Monitoring Alerts has several unique characteristics: (a) high signal-to-noise challenges require strong context (infra topology, deployment history) to set useful alerts; (b) on-call and incident response are interrupt-driven and high-pressure, so speed and clarity of suggestions matter; (c) the overlap with security concerns means monitoring touches compliance-sensitive areas—raising stricter constraints than general dev tasks.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is built by explainability, testable accuracy, and conservative default behaviors. Developers favor AI that recommends or executes low-risk remediations but insist on override points and exhaustive final checks for nontrivial actions. In short, autonomy is acceptable only within a narrow, well-defined trust boundary.

---

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Contradictory perspectives within individuals: A couple of responses blend enthusiasm for automation with cautionary stances—asking for full automation of routine tasks but explicitly disallowing production touches. This ambivalence highlights a desire for toolchains that are both powerful and auditable.

- Strong anti-AI viewpoint: Participant 145’s critique represents a minority but vocal skepticism about managerial embrace of AI despite failures; this signals potential organizational resistance and cultural friction in adoption.

- Security as both a use-case and no-go area: Security appears on both sides—some want AI to detect security anomalies (SFI), while others place security configuration and secrets entirely off-limits. This duality indicates that developers differentiate between detection (acceptable) and authoritative control (unacceptable).

- Desire for AI-driven learning: While rare, some participants explicitly asked that AI support skill-building rather than replacing learning—this suggests design opportunities for tools that scaffold human expertise.

---

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

High-level synthesis: Developers want AI that speeds detection, triage, and routine remediation for monitoring alerts but demand strict guardrails around autonomy, secrets, and critical production actions. Successful tools should emphasize explainable recommendations, reversible low-risk automation, infra-aware configuration, and pathways that improve human operators’ situational awareness and skills.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- Telemetry-driven analysis and RCA assistance
  - Capability: Automated correlation across logs, metrics, and traces to surface anomalies, probable root causes, and relevant historical incidents. Provide ranked hypotheses and evidence links.
  - Rationale: Participants ask for faster root-cause analysis and anomaly detection (“Finding root causes.” — Participant 50; “accelerate root cause analysis…” — Participant 54).

- Alert triage and context enrichment
  - Capability: Automatic summarization of alerts, impact assessment, pre-filled incident templates, and suggested runbook steps; smart routing/escalation recommendations.
  - Rationale: Reduces on-call load and speeds response (“Respond to infrastructure alerts so I don't have to be on-call” — Participant 14; “set up templates for created IcMs.” — Participant 200).

- Infra-aware monitor configuration
  - Capability: Parse infra-as-code and topology to recommend monitors, thresholds, and dependency-aware alert suppression, with ability to simulate alert impact.
  - Rationale: Participants want monitors created from system understanding to reduce false positives and coverage gaps (“For copilot to read our ev2 and know how our infra is setup would be insane.” — Participant 123).

- Explainability, audit trails, and reversible actions
  - Capability: Clear explanation for each suggestion, confidence scores, implicated artifacts, and one-click ways to revert automated changes; comprehensive logging for audits.
  - Rationale: Trust and compliance require traceability and the ability to roll back (“Final checks might need to be more brute force…” — Participant 262).

- Human-in-the-loop controls and role-based constraints
  - Capability: Configurable workflows that permit autonomous remediation only for pre-approved low-risk fixes, and require human signoff for critical changes; explicit off-limits domains (secrets, permissions).
  - Rationale: Developers insist on final human authority for production touches and secret handling (“For critical actions, I would not like AI to take actions on it's own.” — Participant 271; “Secret/keyvault management” — Participant 234).

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- Autonomous production control for critical systems
  - Risk: High risk of downtime and accountability gaps.
  - Example: “Critical customer facing infra shouldn't be handled for safety concerns” (Participant 130).

- Delegation of secrets, key management, and permission changes
  - Risk: Breaches, compliance violations, and loss of control.
  - Example: “Secret/keyvault management” (Participant 234); “Anything regarding permissions … should be off-limit” (Participant 371).

- Black-box autonomous decision-making without explanations or auditability
  - Risk: Erodes trust and prevents meaningful human oversight.
  - Example: “Any activity which cannot be fully and reliably handled by AI should not be done by AI.” (Participant 44).

- Replacing human learning pathways with opaque shortcuts
  - Risk: Junior engineers lose opportunity to build intuition.
  - Example: “The human should always be paramount… AI should be a tool to enhance… not a crutch” (Participant 16).

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop Recommendation Workflow:
  - How it helps: AI produces prioritized, evidence-backed recommendations and can optionally propose low-risk automated actions, but every nontrivial action requires explicit human approval. This satisfies desires for automation while preserving human authority.

- Scoped Autonomous Remediation:
  - How it helps: Define narrow, well-tested remediation playbooks (e.g., restart cache node, clear queue) that AI may execute automatically only when confidence and reversibility criteria are met; everything else is suggested only.

- Explainable Monitoring-as-Code:
  - How it helps: AI reads infra-as-code to generate monitoring configurations alongside human-readable rationales and simulation outputs, enabling engineers to vet and learn from AI-generated monitors.

- Separation of Detection vs Control:
  - How it helps: Treat detection (alerting, anomaly scoring, RCA hints) as AI’s primary domain; treat control (secrets, permissions, production overrides) as human-only or locked behind strict approval workflows.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to analyze telemetry, detect anomalies, predict failures, and accelerate root-cause analysis to reduce MTTR and on-call toil.
- They also want alert triage, context enrichment, infra-aware monitor setup, and automated health checks—but within strict human oversight boundaries.
- Critical design implication: prioritize explainability, audit trails, and reversible actions; make autonomous remediation narrowly scoped and confidence-gated.
- Guardrails: never let AI autonomously manage secrets, permissions, or high-risk production overrides; prefer deterministic automation for precision tasks.
- Notable tension: strong appetite for automation to remove toil versus strong demand that humans retain final authority for safety and learning.
- Recommendation: build AI features as assistant-first workflows (detection + recommendations + optional scoped remediations) that explicitly support operator learning and emphasize transparency.
