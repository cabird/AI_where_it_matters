## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: 1. Proactive Security Risk Detection

Developers want AI to act as an early-warning system: to continuously scan code, telemetry, and development artifacts and surface risks before merges or releases. The researchers’ description—“AI to proactively detect and flag risks before merges/releases, using predictive analytics and telemetry”—matches participants’ emphasis on catching issues while they are low-severity so they can be fixed cheaply. For example, one participant framed this as “real-time risk prediction, compliance monitoring, and automated root cause analysis” to reduce post-incident investigation time (Participant 9). Others envisioned AI evaluating contributions in-flight (“proactively evaluate contributions for potential security issues before I merge changes.” — PID 41) or scanning logs/configs to flag latent failure modes (“If it can scan logs, configs, or workflow patterns and flag things that might break later…that would save me a ton of time.” — PID 301).

The motivation is to reduce manual toil, lower regression/incident rates, and enable teams to focus on root-cause remediation rather than firefighting. Participants also want scale—agents that work across projects and telemetry streams—and early triage so that low-sev deviations can be addressed before escalation. Boundaries mentioned include the need for trustworthy alerts (avoid noisy false positives) and the implication that AI should augment triage, not make final high-stakes decisions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers want AI to proactively detect and flag risks before merges/releases, using predictive analytics and telemetry. Emphasis on catching issues early to reduce regressions and incidents.

Number of participants: ~15 participants (unique PIDs: 9, 21, 41, 167, 183, 217, 241, 286, 301, 317, 329, 346, 374, 397)

Representative quotes:
- *“I’d like AI to play a major role in real-time risk prediction, compliance monitoring, and automated root cause analysis.”* (Participant 9)
- *“I want AI to proactively evaluate contributions for potential security issues before I merge changes.”* (Participant 41)
- *“If it can scan logs, configs, or workflow patterns and flag things that might break later…that would save me a ton of time.”* (Participant 301)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: 2. Compliance Automation & Standard Enforcement (incl. Overhead & Accuracy)

Participants want AI to take on repetitive compliance tasks, enforce organizational standards, and reduce drudgery—especially where checks are tedious but well-specified (e.g., accessibility, localization, cryptography standards). The coded description emphasizes reducing overhead and improving accuracy/confidence in checks. Developers expect AI to produce first-draft security reviews, complete long questionnaire-style audits, and apply documented best practices where documentation is clear (“LLMs really shine when there is clear, robust documentation…” — PID 140). They want AI to indicate the confidence of its checks so humans can prioritize review time (“mention in a comment that it has reviewed ‘xyz’ aspects … and the confidence of the review” — PID 410).

Motivation is two-fold: reduce time spent on form-filling and boilerplate, and make compliance less boring and more reliable. Conditions include the requirement for accuracy (avoid false positives/negatives) and integration points where AI prepares drafts or suggestions but humans give final sign-off.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers want AI to handle repetitive compliance tasks and enforce standards. They also emphasize accuracy and confidence in security/compliance checks to reduce false positives and give reliable guidance.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 71, 83, 117, 140, 199, 203, 331, 354, 385, 410)

Representative quotes:
- *“Code review feedback including security and compliance checks. Specifically, accessibility, localization, and security issues.”* (Participant 71)
- *“AI should be able to handle a first-draft and information retrieval [for security reviews].”* (Participant 203)
- *“Look for all common coding misses in Code reviews and mention … the confidence of the review so that human reviewers can look at other aspects.”* (Participant 410)

Confidence: High

#### Theme: 3. Test Generation, Exploratory & Chaos Testing

Developers see AI as a powerful engine for generating and maintaining tests, including adversarial and exploratory (chaos) testing. The researchers’ description—automatic generation of robust tests, adversarial probing, and test suite maintenance—captures participants’ desire for AI to surface scenarios humans might not imagine. Several respondents want AI to “act as a great adversary” and automatically create test cases and chaos environments to uncover authentication/authorization gaps and other security holes (PID 117, PID 299, PID 46).

The outcome developers expect is stronger verification, better test coverage, and reduced manual effort to design comprehensive, realistic tests. They also want AI to help refactor and maintain test suites as code changes. Conditions include giving AI sufficient context (project files, workflows) and validating AI-generated tests before they run in production or CI.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers envision AI generating robust tests, probing systems adversarially, and maintaining/refactoring test suites. Seen as critical to strengthening verification and reducing toil.

Number of participants: ~10 participants (unique PIDs: 46, 47, 117, 152, 241, 299, 304, 314, 330, 332, 354)

Representative quotes:
- *“I want AI to automatically detect security risks and create chaos testing environments…could be discovered through random exploration.”* (Participant 46)
- *“AI can play a huge role here and ease developers' life in writing exhaustive test cases. AI can act as a great adversary.”* (Participant 299)
- *“AI should be able to generate tests automatically when given the context of the files to cover.”* (Participant 332)

Confidence: High

---

#### Theme: 4. Context-Aware and Localized Fix Suggestions

Participants want AI to go beyond generic advice and recommend fixes that respect local project conventions, dependencies, and team norms. The description emphasizes AI understanding local context and making PRs or reviewable actions that align with how teams actually ship code. For example, one participant described wanting AI that “understand[s] the local context for a security issue, and make a PR, or other reviewable action to take” (PID 205). Another asked for AI to “handle S360 items … only asking for final confirmation,” implying AI should be confident about local patterns and present a tentative fix rather than taking direct action (PID 410).

The motivation is to reduce back-and-forth in reviews and ensure suggested fixes are practical and adoptable. Boundaries include requiring human confirmation before code changes are committed to shared repositories or production.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Developers want AI not only to detect risks but also to suggest or implement fixes that account for local project context and team norms.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 205, 410)

Representative quotes:
- *“It would be nice to have an AI understand the local context for a security issue, and make a PR, or other reviewable action to take.”* (Participant 205)
- *“Handle S360 items on its own only asking for final confirmation from the user.”* (Participant 410)

Confidence: Low

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Final Accountability, Decision Control, and Ethical Judgment Must Stay Human

Participants were explicit that AI should not assume final responsibility in high-stakes, ethical, or nuanced decisions. The primary code—“High-stakes, ethical, and nuanced decisions require humans”—captures a widespread view that human intuition, empathy, and accountability remain essential in choices like release readiness, incident triage, or communicating risks to leadership. For instance, PID 9 said they “wouldn’t want AI to handle final decision-making in high-stakes risk scenarios,” and PID 57 objected to AI overriding human judgment in incident triaging.

The feared outcomes include misplaced responsibility, loss of context in judgement calls, and ethical oversights that AI cannot reliably assess. A common boundary: AI can assist with analysis but final judgments and communications should be human-led.

Sub-themes identified:
- **High-stakes, ethical, and nuanced decisions require humans**: Developers emphasize that final accountability, ethical trade-offs, and nuanced decisions must remain human-led. AI can assist, but not replace human intuition, empathy, and responsibility.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 9, 14, 57, 301)

Representative quotes:
- *“I wouldn’t want AI to handle final decision-making in high-stakes risk scenarios…the responsibility should remain with experienced professionals.”* (Participant 9)
- *“I want to make the final decision about what risks are worth taking.”* (Participant 14)
- *“I don’t want AI to make final decisions on critical production rollouts or override human judgment in incident triaging…”* (Participant 57)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: No autonomous AI actions or direct production/system changes without sign-off

Developers strongly oppose autonomous AI actions that change production systems, commit code, or resolve security items without human approval. The researchers’ description—“oppose AI automatically committing code, applying security fixes, updating configs, or handling S360 items”—reflects concerns about accidental misconfigurations, broken deployments, and loss of human accountability. Several participants insisted that any generated code or fixes require developer validation (“a developer needs to validate the results of any generated code” — PID 41) and that AI should not be allowed to make unreviewed changes to cloud subscriptions or production resources (PID 205).

The core concern is safety: automatic fixes can have production-facing implications, and humans must retain control over changes that affect users. A key boundary is explicit sign-off and staged application (e.g., PR-only suggestions, sandboxed testing).

Sub-themes identified:
- **No autonomous AI actions or direct production/system changes without sign-off**: Developers strongly oppose AI automatically committing code, applying security fixes, updating configs, or handling S360 items. They stress that production systems must not be altered by AI without explicit human oversight and approval.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 23, 41, 149, 205, 410)

Representative quotes:
- *“Directly touching production without oversight.”* (Participant 23)
- *“I do not want AI to be solely responsible for quality and security; a developer needs to validate the results of any generated code…”* (Participant 41)
- *“Auto commit fixes for S360 item resolution. This may have production user facing implications.”* (Participant 410)

Confidence: Medium

---

#### Theme: Quality and Trust Issues

Participants worry AI is opaque, may produce poor or incorrect outputs, and cannot be relied upon for verification. The code—“Transparency, correctness, and verification limits”—captures distrust in black-box models for security-critical tasks. For example, PID 1 said “letting current AI handle security and compliance work is risky” and demanded tools that can “guarantee correctness.” Others emphasized that humans must define verification criteria (PID 165) and that AI-generated documentation (threat models, security design) is often low quality (PID 167).

The feared outcome is misplaced assurance: teams might accept an AI’s conclusion without sufficient verification, leading to security regressions. Boundaries include requiring explainability, human-defined verification rules, and skepticism of AI-produced artifacts unless traceable and auditable.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Transparency, correctness, and verification limits**: Developers see AI as opaque and untrustworthy for verification. They fear it may provide incomplete or false assurances of security, making it dangerous to use AI as the sole source of truth.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 1, 165, 167, 228)

Representative quotes:
- *“I think letting current AI handle security and compliance work is risky and I wouldn't trust it.”* (Participant 1)
- *“Security/compliance is hard…You can't reliably depend on an AI system for the verification criteria; a human has to define that.”* (Participant 165)
- *“I do not want the AI to write threat models or security design documentation…too primitive.”* (Participant 167)

Confidence: Low

---

#### Theme: Privacy and sensitive data handling

Developers do not want AI systems to directly process or have uncontrolled access to sensitive user or customer data. The code—“AI should not directly access or process sensitive information”—reflects concerns about breaches, privacy violations, and data leakage through AI tools. Participants stated that privacy-related tasks should be handled manually and that AI should be prevented from touching user/customer data (“AI should not be allowed to handle User or customer's data as it could lead to a breach…” — PID 282).

The boundary is clear: limit AI access to sensitive data, require strict controls (redaction, local-only models, or explicit approval), and maintain human responsibility for privacy-sensitive actions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **Privacy and sensitive data handling**: AI should not directly access or process sensitive information (e.g., user/customer data, confidential project data), as this could lead to breaches and privacy violations.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (unique PIDs: 180, 282, 397)

Representative quotes:
- *“Tasks which involve privacy, I feel individual needs to do on their own.”* (Participant 180)
- *“AI should not be allowed to handle User or customer's data as it could lead to a breach of confidential / privacy data.”* (Participant 282)
- *“I don't want AI to directly handle sensitive information, as I don't trust that information it sees stays truly secure.”* (Participant 397)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to surface risks early, automate repetitive compliance checks, generate tests, and suggest localized fixes—tasks that reduce toil and scale triage. Simultaneously they insist AI must not assume responsibility or make autonomous changes. The result is a clear split: AI is valued as an assistant for detection, suggestion, and test generation, but not as an autonomous actor that finalizes decisions or changes production.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Common conditions include human-in-the-loop confirmation, explicit confidence/uncertainty reporting, auditable traceability, and constraints on access to sensitive data. Tools that produce first drafts, PRs, or sandboxed tests are acceptable; tools that auto-commit or enact changes without sign-off are not.

- Task-specific nuances: Security Compliance differs from general coding tasks because errors have regulatory, privacy, and user-safety consequences. Participants emphasized verification, explainability, and alignment with documented standards (e.g., cryptography, accessibility), which makes deterministic checking and evidence trails more important than fluent natural-language assistance alone.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust hinges on transparency, verifiability, and the ability to assign human accountability. Developers want clear signals about an AI’s confidence and provenance of its findings. Control levers (review gates, sign-off, role-based access) are required to reconcile AI’s utility with the need for human judgment and responsibility.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Contradictory within-individual responses: Some participants express both enthusiasm and caution (e.g., PID 9 and PID 301 appear in both “want” and “don’t want” themes), advocating for AI-powered detection but rejecting AI-driven final decisions—showing nuanced, context-dependent attitudes.

- Minority perspectives favoring higher autonomy: A small subset implicitly trusts AI to take more action (e.g., requests for AI to “handle S360 items on its own only asking for final confirmation” — PID 410), suggesting staged autonomy (AI does work, humans confirm) could be acceptable to many.

- Ambivalent quality views: While many ask for automated compliance, several also distrust AI-created artifacts (threat models, security docs), implying that some outputs are valued (tests, defect detection) while others (high-level design docs) are not.

- Unique emphasis on telemetry-level detection: Some participants (e.g., PID 183) requested at-scale telemetry platforms that AI can leverage—an operational focus beyond per-PR static analysis that suggests investments in observability + AI integration may yield outsized benefits.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers expect AI tools for Security Compliance to be powerful detectors and assistants but constrained by human oversight, explainability, and privacy protections. Designers should prioritize actionable detection, test generation, context-aware suggestions, and robust controls that ensure humans remain accountable.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Proactive risk detection and telemetry integration**
  - Capability: Continuous, predictive scanning of code, CI artifacts, logs, and telemetry to surface low-severity deviations, trending risks, and early indicators of incidents.
  - Rationale: Participants want early detection to prevent regressions and focus on root causes (PID 9, PID 301).
  - Example: “real-time risk prediction, compliance monitoring, and automated root cause analysis” (PID 9).

- **Compliance automation with confidence indicators**
  - Capability: Auto-populate compliance forms, produce first-draft security review artifacts, and signal confidence levels and what checks were run.
  - Rationale: Reduces overhead while enabling reviewers to triage AI-suggested items (PID 203, PID 410).
  - Example: “mention … the confidence of the review so that human reviewers can look at other aspects” (PID 410).

- **Automated test generation and adversarial/chaos testing**
  - Capability: Generate unit/integration tests, adversarial test scenarios, and chaos experiments from project context; maintain/refactor test suites over time.
  - Rationale: Strengthens verification and finds scenarios humans miss (PID 46, PID 299, PID 332).
  - Example: “AI can act as a great adversary” (PID 299).

- **Context-aware, reviewable fix suggestions (PR workflow)**
  - Capability: Produce reviewable PRs or patch suggestions that respect local coding styles, dependencies, and team norms; include rationale and risk summary.
  - Rationale: Reduces friction in adopting fixes and ensures changes fit project context (PID 205, PID 410).
  - Example: “make a PR, or other reviewable action to take” (PID 205).

- **Explainability and auditable provenance**
  - Capability: For every flagged issue, provide evidence (stack traces, telemetry snippets, diffs), rationale, and links to standards or documentation used.
  - Rationale: Builds trust and enables human verification (PID 165, PID 167, PID 228).
  - Example: “You can't reliably depend on an AI system for the verification criteria; a human has to define that.” (PID 165).

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous production changes without explicit human sign-off**
  - Risk: Automatic commits, config edits, or subscription changes can cause outages or data exposure (PID 23, PID 205).
  - Guardrail: All production-facing changes must be PRs or require explicit human approval and staged rollouts.
  - Example: “Directly touching production without oversight.” (PID 23)

- **AI final decision-making in high-stakes contexts**
  - Risk: Ethical trade-offs, release decisions, and incident communications demand human judgment (PID 9, PID 57).
  - Guardrail: AI can recommend, but humans retain final authorization and accountability.
  - Example: “I want to make the final decision about what risks are worth taking.” (PID 14)

- **Opaque verification or black-box assertions**
  - Risk: Blind reliance on AI outputs without traceability can produce false assurance (PID 1, PID 228).
  - Guardrail: Provide traceable evidence, model explanations, and allow reproducible checks so humans can verify.

- **Unrestricted access to sensitive data**
  - Risk: Privacy breaches from AI processing customer or sensitive project data (PID 282, PID 397).
  - Guardrail: Enforce data minimization, redaction, local-only processing, and role-based access controls.

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop, staged autonomy: AI performs detection, suggests fixes, and generates PRs/tests in sandbox; human approves before any production change. This satisfies desires for automation while preserving accountability.

- Confidence + provenance UI: Surface confidence scores plus links to the evidence and the standard/rule applied. This lets reviewers triage AI output and reduces over-reliance.

- Scoped access with synthetic data or redaction: Enable AI to operate on non-sensitive derivatives or with strict redaction for privacy-sensitive artifacts, balancing utility and safety.

- Audit trail + explainability layer: Keep immutable logs of AI suggestions, model version, data used, and reviewer actions to enable post-hoc audits and meet regulatory requirements.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to proactively detect risks, generate tests (including adversarial/chaos tests), and automate compliance tasks to reduce toil and catch issues early.
- At the same time, they insist final accountability, ethical decisions, and production changes remain human-controlled.
- Design must prioritize explainability, confidence indicators, and auditable evidence so humans can verify AI findings.
- Tools should generate reviewable artifacts (PRs, tests, compliance drafts) and avoid autonomous commits or direct production edits without explicit sign-off.
- Key tensions center on automation versus control: developers welcome suggestions and detection but reject opaque, autonomous actions affecting users or sensitive data.
- Recommendation: build AI assistants that work in a human-in-the-loop workflow, integrate telemetry for proactive detection, and enforce strict privacy and sign-off guardrails.
