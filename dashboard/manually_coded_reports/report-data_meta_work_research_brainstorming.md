## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: 1. Information Synthesis & Summarization

Participants see clear utility in AI that can gather, collate, and summarize large or distributed information sources to speed up research work. The core expectation is that AI should act like an informed interlocutor who surfaces the most relevant facts and documentation, reducing the time spent scanning many documents. This desire is tightly coupled with a need for verifiable outputs: several participants asked that AI “cite sources” and warned about hallucinations, indicating that summaries must be grounded in traceable references. The motivation is efficiency—turning large research corpora into digestible overviews—while the boundary is human validation and source transparency.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI should gather, collate, and summarize relevant information from large or distributed sources, improving efficiency in research 

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 20, 28, 66, 336 → 4)

Representative quotes:
- *"AI is great for research, as long as it cites sources. It's more like talking to someone who knows about a subject than having to read through documentation."* (Participant 20)
- *"Researching should be where AI plays a big role in the future, to easily pick out relevant information from large amounts of research data."* (Participant 28)
- *"Automatic documentation from code, auto collation and summarization of resources from different sources."* (Participant 336)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: 2. Brainstorming & Ideation Support

Developers expressed interest in AI as a thought partner that can generate ideas, propose technical solutions, or outline project roadmaps given high-level prompts. The desired outcome is a collaborator that accelerates ideation—helping surface directions or break down vague concepts into actionable plans—while leaving final judgments to humans. Several participants framed AI’s role as a “sounding board” for research or as a tool to create roadmaps and task breakdowns once provided with an initial concept. Boundaries include the need for human validation and the risk that AI might produce familiar or derivative ideas rather than truly novel solutions.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI should act as a thought partner, helping brainstorm technical solutions, generate ideas, or create project roadmaps when given high-level prompts.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 17, 160, 189, 333 → 4)

Representative quotes:
- *"AI shouldn't be involved in most of these tasks, but can be OK at documenting existing code and as a sounding board for research, as long as there is human validation…"* (Participant 17)
- *"Create roadmap and breakdown of tasks when given high level idea of the next projects."* (Participant 160)
- *"An AI that can help with research and brainstorming of technical things would be very useful."* (Participant 189)

Confidence: Low

#### Theme: 3. Adaptive & Personalized Assistance

There is interest in AI that adapts to an individual developer’s context, knowledge level, and project history. Participants want personalized learning support, study materials tailored to their experience, and continuity via long-term memory that understands ongoing projects. The motivation is to reduce onboarding time for new technologies and to make research assistance more relevant and actionable. Boundaries include privacy and correctness of the personalized memory: participants implied that contextualization must be accurate and trustworthy to actually save time.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: AI should adapt to the developer’s context, knowledge, and projects — providing learning support, tailored materials, and continuity through memory.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 195, 280, 360 → 3)

Representative quotes:
- *"Learning new technologies as well as Research. ML currently cuts down time on these tasks significantly for me, and I like to see that continue."* (Participant 195)
- *"Research and learning. I want it take into account my own knowledge and experience to provide study materials."* (Participant 280)
- *"A contextual AI assistant with long term memory that understands my needs and my projects."* (Participant 360)

Confidence: Low

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Quality and Trust Issues

A primary barrier to adopting AI for research is distrust in the quality, timeliness, and correctness of AI outputs. Participants reported that AI can be outdated, hallucinate facts, or simply be of poor quality for nuanced, up-to-date technical topics; as a result, many prefer consulting official documentation or validated sources directly. The feared outcomes are wasted time verifying incorrect suggestions and making decisions based on faulty information. The boundary is clear: AI may assist in parts of research, but cannot be relied upon as the primary authoritative source without transparent provenance and recency.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Participants highlight reliability, timeliness, and correctness concerns. They do not trust AI outputs for research, citing outdated info, hallucinations, or poor quality. Prefer official/validated sources.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 44, 262, 292, 353, 379 → 5)

Representative quotes:
- *"Research and Learning new technologies requires nuanced knowledge and AI is not reliable in providing up to date information…"* (Participant 44)
- *"I don't trust Copilot for helping me research, it's often wrong or outdated… I prefer going straight to official technical documentation."* (Participant 353)
- *"I think AI can help with part of research but it's not good enough to come up with new solutions yet."* (Participant 262)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: Avoid Intellectual Offloading

Many participants explicitly resist outsourcing core creative or intellectual parts of research and brainstorming to AI. They see these activities as valuable opportunities for human growth, creativity, and decision-making; using AI as a shortcut risks stifling originality and reducing learning. The feared outcome is dependence—losing the exercise of problem-solving and producing shallow or derivative ideas. Boundaries include preserving human-led ideation and using AI only as a facilitator rather than a substitute for the cognitive work developers want to retain.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Research and brainstorming are viewed as intellectual, creative exercises that should remain human-led. AI risks stifling originality, reducing learning opportunities, or replacing valuable effort.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 18, 161, 186, 217, 228, 362, 366 → 7)

Representative quotes:
- *"Research and brainstorming require a lot of human creativity and mental efforts… I don't want AI to interfere."* (Participant 18)
- *"Coming up with new ideas since it's more designed to output something it's already seen before."* (Participant 186)
- *"Brainstorming because I want to use my own brain and force myself to think."* (Participant 366)

Confidence: Medium

#### Theme: AI as a Facilitator, Not Decision Maker - Need for oversight

Several participants accept AI in a constrained supporting role—surfacing prompts, asking clarifying questions, or facilitating exploration—but insist on human oversight for analysis and final decisions. They want AI to help structure thinking without being given full control of deep thought or analysis. The concern is that undue reliance or literal acceptance of AI suggestions can lead to poor outcomes; therefore, validation and deliberate human judgment are required boundaries.

Sub-themes identified:
- **(No code)**: Some are okay with AI in a limited supporting role (e.g., surfacing prompts, asking questions), but insist that humans must retain control and make the final judgments.

Number of participants: ~5 participants (actual unique PIDs: 142, 217, 262 → 3)

Representative quotes:
- *"I don't want to give full control to AI for deep thought and analysis for research… I would like to validate its work."* (Participant 142)
- *"Research and brainstorming are exercises it can help ask questions to facilitate, but we shouldn't go with its first ideas…"* (Participant 217)
- *"I think AI can help with part of research but it's not good enough to come up with new solutions yet."* (Participant 262)

Confidence: Low

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to reduce routine burdens—summarizing documentation, surfacing ideas, and tailoring learning—while simultaneously fearing that AI could degrade creativity, provide incorrect or outdated information, or replace valuable cognitive work. The “want” themes lean toward augmentation (efficiency, personalized support), and the “don’t want” themes stress preservation of human judgment and learning.

- Conditional acceptance: Across responses, acceptance of AI is conditional. Useful boundaries include: source citations and recency for synthesis; human validation for brainstorming outputs; and configurability of AI autonomy. Participants repeatedly require transparency and control as preconditions for deployment in research contexts.

- Task-specific nuances: Research Brainstorming requires both factual accuracy (to inform decisions) and creative novelty (to explore new designs). That duality makes it more sensitive than purely mechanical tasks: participants want factual synthesis and idea-stimulating prompts but reject automated decision-making or creative outsourcing that could hamper learning.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is fragile and built on verifiability. Participants expect provenance (citations, timestamps), explainability (why suggestions were made), and human-in-the-loop workflows. They favor tools that facilitate thinking (questions, outlines, alternatives) over prescriptive recommendations.

---

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives: A few participants combine cautious openness with strong boundaries—e.g., Participant 17 notes AI “shouldn't be involved in most of these tasks” yet accepts it as a “sounding board.” These nuanced positions indicate a readiness to trial AI in narrow roles.

- Unique insights: Requests for long-term contextual memory (Participant 360) stand out as higher-ambition features: personalized, project-aware assistance that persists over time, which could substantially change research workflows but raises privacy and correctness concerns.

- Ambivalent responses: Several participants occupy both sides of the ledger—acknowledging time savings from AI (learning new tech) while mistrusting outputs. This ambivalence suggests staged adoption where limited, verifiable capabilities are used first.

- Contradictions within individuals: Participant 217 appears in both “Avoid Intellectual Offloading” and “AI as Facilitator,” signaling a nuanced stance: they see value in facilitation (AI asking questions) but resist delegating ideation. This reinforces the need for tools that are explicitly assistive rather than substitutive.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

High-level synthesis:
Developers want AI that augments research brainstorming by synthesizing information, stimulating ideas, and adapting to their context—but only when outputs are transparent, verifiable, and clearly positioned as assistance rather than authority. Tools must prioritize provenance, configurability, and mechanisms that preserve human creativity and learning.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Accurate Information Synthesis with Citations**
  - Capability: Summarize and collate relevant sources while attaching provenance (links, timestamps, and confidence indicators).
  - Rationale: Participants explicitly requested cites and noted hallucinations as a core failure mode. (*"AI is great for research, as long as it cites sources."* — PID 20)

- **Faceted Brainstorming Support (sounding-board mode)**
  - Capability: Provide alternative approaches, roadmaps, and task breakdowns given high-level prompts, and offer scaffolding questions rather than prescriptive solutions.
  - Rationale: Developers want idea generation and structuring help without surrendering final judgment. (*"Create roadmap and breakdown of tasks..."* — PID 160)

- **Contextual Personalization & Memory (configurable)**
  - Capability: Remember project-relevant context and adapt suggestions to the user’s knowledge level, with opt-in controls for what is stored.
  - Rationale: Personalized learning and continuity can speed onboarding, but must be controlled. (*"A contextual AI assistant with long term memory..."* — PID 360)

- **Uncertainty & Validation Signals**
  - Capability: Surface confidence scores, explain reasoning, and flag when recommended material may be outdated.
  - Rationale: Trust depends on knowing limits of the model; participants want to validate outputs. (*"I would like to validate its work."* — PID 142)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Treating AI as an Authoritative Decision-Maker**
  - Risk: Overreliance leading to poor decisions and loss of developer learning.
  - Rationale: Participants insist on human control and reject AI-driven final judgments. (*"I don't want to give full control to AI for deep thought..."* — PID 142)

- **Opaque, Source-less Summaries**
  - Risk: Hallucination and outdated information undermine trust.
  - Rationale: Multiple participants prefer official docs when AI lacks provenance. (*"I don't trust Copilot... I prefer going straight to official technical documentation."* — PID 353)

- **Features that Encourage Intellectual Offloading**
  - Risk: Reducing developers’ creative engagement and growth.
  - Rationale: Participants emphasize the value of doing research themselves. (*"Brainstorming because I want to use my own brain..."* — PID 366)

- **Persistent Context without User Control**
  - Risk: Privacy concerns and incorrect personalization.
  - Rationale: While memory is desired, it must be opt-in and editable. (*"I want it take into account my own knowledge..."* — PID 280)

#### Design Patterns to Resolve Tensions

- Human-in-the-loop Summaries: Combine automated synthesis with explicit source links and a “verify” workflow that nudges developers to confirm or reject key claims—this balances efficiency with trust.

- Scaffolded Ideation Mode: Offer a “facilitator” UI that generates questions, alternative angles, and structured roadmaps rather than final solutions; include a toggle to increase/decrease suggestion specificity.

- Configurable Memory & Privacy Controls: Let users opt into project-level memory with clear visibility and easy deletion; provide UI showing what is stored and why it influenced a suggestion.

- Uncertainty-aware Recommendations: Pair each generated idea or summary with a confidence estimate and provenance; encourage rather than replace human creativity by presenting multiple diverse, labeled options.

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to accelerate research by synthesizing information, summarizing documentation, and helping brainstorm roadmaps and ideas—provided outputs are verifiable.
- They do not want AI to replace human creativity or act as the final decision-maker; core research and ideation must remain human-led.
- Critical design imperatives: provenance (citations/timestamps), uncertainty signals, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
- Tools should prioritize scaffolded facilitation (questions, alternatives, roadmaps) over prescriptive solutions and support opt-in, editable contextual memory.
- Major tension: desire for efficiency vs. fear of degraded learning and hallucinations; resolve this with transparency and configurable autonomy.
- Recommendation: build assistive features first (syntheses with sources, facilitator modes, personalized study aids) and enforce guardrails that maintain human judgment and developer growth.
