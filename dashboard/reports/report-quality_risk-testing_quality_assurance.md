# Thematic Analysis — Testing & Quality Assurance

I reviewed participant responses and focused only on comments explicitly about Testing & Quality Assurance (TQA). I coded statements for recurring goals, concerns, and constraints, then grouped them into thematic clusters that reflect task value (what TQA activities save time or add value), identity and accountability (who owns decisions), and cognitive demands (where AI helps versus where human judgment is needed). Counts are rough and rounded to the nearest five.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Test generation and automation  
   - Description: Participants overwhelmingly want AI to take over repetitive, high-volume testing tasks: generate unit tests, end-to-end scenarios, test data, and boilerplate so teams obtain much higher coverage with less manual toil. The context is both greenfield and legacy code where gaps are tedious to close; the motivation is efficiency and reducing repetitive labor so developers and PMs can specify intent and let AI produce tests. Desired outcomes include automatically created, maintainable tests and test scaffolding that developers can review and iterate on. Many set a boundary that AI-generated tests should be reviewable and integrated into existing CI pipelines rather than blindly trusted.  
   - Number of participants: ~45 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"More automated tests built by AI that even a PM could specify what they want to test and AI handles it"* (Participant 35)  
     - *"I would really like to have AI help with writing tests."* (Participant 126)  
     - *"To analyse missing test coverage and implement tests on its own"* (Participant 408)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 2. Theme: Proactive regression, coverage and risk detection  
   - Description: Developers want AI to shift QA from reactive firefighting to proactive risk management by detecting regressions, surfacing coverage gaps, predicting high‑risk change areas, and tracking risk trends across codebases. The context includes PRs, CI runs, and long‑running systems where human reviewers miss patterns. Motivation is to reduce surprises in production, prioritize tests and fixes, and save time. Expected outcomes are early alerts, prioritized test suggestions, and dashboards highlighting risky areas; participants expect human triage and accountability for any flagged issues.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"play a major role in proactively detecting regressions, analyzing test coverage gaps, and predicting high-risk areas..."* (Participant 57)  
     - *"help most with automating quality checks and surfacing hidden risks early."* (Participant 301)  
     - *"AI shows promise in detecting deviations from a known good baseline."* (Participant 167)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 3. Theme: Security, fuzzing and adversarial testing  
   - Description: Many see AI as valuable for security testing—spotting vulnerabilities, acting as an adversary, performing chaos/fuzz testing, and checking authentication/authorization paths. The context spans static code checks, API/back-end testing, and exploratory “white-hat” probing across workflows. Motivation is to find hard-to-imagine edge cases and security gaps faster than manual review. Outcome expectations include automated vulnerability identification, scenario generation for security testing, and suggested mitigations; participants usually require human validation and contextual judgment for any security remediation.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I want AI to automatically detect security risks and create chaos testing environments..."* (Participant 46)  
     - *"Identify errors and vulnerabilities in code."* (Participant 21)  
     - *"try to sniff out any authentication or authorization gaps in our web services."* (Participant 117)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 4. Theme: PR review, debugging help, and CI/CD integration  
   - Description: Participants want AI to assist as a pair‑programmer for PR reviews, suggest/refactor tests, help debug variants, and integrate more tightly with version control and CI/CD (e.g., add files, open adds in Perforce, run tests). Motivation is to speed review cycles, reduce context switching, and get targeted test suggestions during development. Desired outcomes include automated PR checks that propose tests, actionable debugging assistance, and smooth integration into existing workflows; most expect humans to make final commit/release decisions.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Automatically review PR and write high quality tests as a pair programmer."* (Participant 283)  
     - *"more assistance in debugging would be huge... more integration when making larger additions to a codebase."* (Participant 103)  
     - *"I would be happy for AI to take over code review if it's capable."* (Participant 189)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Final decision‑making and release/sign‑off authority  
   - Description: A strong boundary is that AI must not make final judgments about release readiness, risk acceptance, or critical production rollouts. The context is high‑stakes decisions where accountability, business context, and ethical considerations matter. Concerns center on legal/operational responsibility and the need for human accountability; feared outcomes include inappropriate releases and unclear ownership. Participants conditionally accept AI support for analysis and suggestions but insist on human sign‑off and audit trails of what the AI did.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don’t want AI to make final decisions on critical production rollouts or override human judgment..."* (Participant 57)  
     - *"I don't want AI to make final decisions on release readiness or risk acceptance."* (Participant 241)  
     - *"The result is owned by the person who committed and/or signed off on the code generated by an LLM."* (Participant 140)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 2. Theme: Lack of trust, correctness and hallucination risk  
   - Description: Participants worry AI is currently unreliable, hallucinates, and cannot be depended on for accurate verification of correctness or risk. The context includes security assessments and quality verification where false positives/negatives or fabricated outputs are costly. The concern is that AI can present plausible but incorrect conclusions; feared outcomes are missed vulnerabilities, incorrect fixes, and misplaced confidence. Boundaries include requiring higher accuracy, evidence (screenshots/logs), and conservative behavior when uncertain.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI ... frequently hallucinates with absolute certainty that its hallucinations are real."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"Based on my experience so far, I do not trust AI for my specific role."* (Participant 53)  
     - *"I do not think AI can be used for verification of quality ... humans cannot make sense of what the AI is doing 'underneath the hood'."* (Participant 228)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 3. Theme: No sole responsibility — human verification required  
   - Description: Closely related to trust and accountability, many insist AI must not be solely responsible for code quality, security, or for evaluating its own results. The context is code generation, test creation, and QA assessment where engineers must validate AI outputs. Concerns include developers being forced to accept poor AI code and reduced learning/ownership. Feared outcomes are blind acceptance of bad code or tests; participants require human validation, traceable test artifacts, and explicit review workflows.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I do not want AI to be solely responsible for quality and security; a developer needs to validate the results..."* (Participant 41)  
     - *"Ultimately it is a human's decision as to whether or not the project meets a certain level of quality."* (Participant 103)  
     - *"When you develop feature with Gen AI, you must not have a Gen AI system to evaluate itself."* (Participant 345)  
   - Confidence: High  


#### 4. Theme: Reliability, performance and verification limits (speed, UI automation correctness, false positives)  
   - Description: Participants flagged practical limits: slow processing, brittle UI automation that is hard to verify, false positives, and AI systems that make assumptions instead of failing safely. The context is CI runs, UI automation, and large analyses where delays or noise reduce value. Concerns include wasting time correcting AI output or debugging flaky automated tests. Boundaries include expecting fast responses, low false positive rates, clear failure modes, and explicit "I don't know" behavior.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"UI automation might be difficult to verify if AI tries to do it and doesn't do it correctly."* (Participant 71)  
     - *"Improving AI performance is important, I don't want AI to take too long to process."* (Participant 314)  
     - *"If there is something that it is not capable of doing, abort with that information, rather than making some assumptions."* (Participant 336)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections: The strongest link is between desire for automation (test generation, coverage analysis) and the simultaneous insistence on human oversight. Developers want AI to reduce repetitive testing toil and surface risks, but they want traceable artifacts and human sign‑off for any actions that affect release or security.
- Tensions: There's a clear tension between enthusiasm for AI-driven test creation and skepticism about AI's correctness: many want AI to write tests and catch regressions but will not trust those tests to gate releases without human review. Some participants want AI to "take over" code review or testing if it is reliable, showing conditional acceptance tied to demonstrated accuracy.
- Conditions/boundaries: Common constraints include: AI must provide evidence (logs, screenshots), be conservative when uncertain (return "I don't know"), integrate into CI/CD without auto-committing, and ensure humans define acceptance criteria and test requirements (i.e., humans set the goals; AI executes).
  
### Relation to other tasks
- Participants directly contrasted TQA with manual QA and release decisions: many want AI to replace or augment manual QA work (e.g., exploratory/manual testing) but explicitly not to replace human final decisions or requirements-setting. Several comments compared AI's role in TQA to code review and debugging support, indicating TQA is seen as a high-value area for automation relative to more creative tasks like design or requirement definition.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full autonomy proponents: A small number (e.g., Participant 299) believe AI can and should do nearly all TQA tasks, including exhaustive test generation and acting as adversary, with minimal constraints.
- Full rejection until proven: A few participants (e.g., Participant 53, 145) want no AI involvement until accuracy is demonstrably better than humans; they advocate a “prove it first” stance.
- Misfiled/mixed responses: Some responses appeared in the “don’t want” field yet expressed desire for automation (e.g., Participant 213), indicating mixed or strong enthusiasm but possibly data-entry inconsistency.
- Unique asks: A handful requested very specific capabilities like AI creating chaos testing environments (Participant 46) or opening Perforce adds automatically (Participant 103) — concrete integration points that go beyond generic test generation.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

High-level takeaway: Build AI TQA tooling that automates repetitive test creation, proactively surfaces risks, and integrates tightly with developer workflows — but design it with human-in-the-loop controls, strong evidence/traceability, conservative behavior on uncertainty, and clear abort/verification modes.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Test generation engine
  - Automatically generate unit, integration, and E2E tests and test data from code, layouts, and PR diffs; prioritize maintainability and readability so developers can review quickly.
- Risk/regression detection and coverage analysis
  - Provide regression detection, coverage-gap analysis, and prioritized risk scoring across PRs and commits with trend tracking to help focus remediation.
- Security/adversarial testing module
  - Offer automated vulnerability scanning, fuzzing/chaos scenarios, and adversarial test generation tailored to APIs and auth/authorization flows.
- Explainability, evidence and traceability
  - Produce verifiable artifacts (test logs, screenshots, request/response traces) and an audit trail for each AI action so humans can validate claims.
- Human-in-the-loop controls & gates
  - Require human approval for commits/releases; expose editable acceptance criteria; allow easy rejection/adjustment of AI-suggested tests before merge.
- Integration and performance
  - Fast operation inside CI/CD and VCS workflows (PR comments, pre-commit hooks) with the ability to open/add files or propose changes without auto-committing.
- Safe failure modes
  - Transparent uncertainty handling (“I don't know”), explicit aborts rather than speculative fixes, and low tolerated false-positive rates.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Fully autonomous release/sign-off
  - Do not allow AI to make final release decisions or accept risk on behalf of humans.
- Opaque verification acceptance
  - Avoid black‑box verdicts without evidence; tools should not assert "quality OK" without traceable artifacts.
- Auto-committing or auto-checking in without approval
  - Prevent autonomous check-ins or deployments without explicit human sign-off.
- Hallucination-prone behaviors
  - Do not fabricate test data, verification screenshots, or claim to have run tests if it has not; prefer conservative “cannot verify” responses.

(Optional) Design patterns to resolve tensions: adopt "suggest-and-verify" workflows where AI proposes tests and a human acceptance step signs them into CI; provide "explainable failures" and a confidence score for each suggestion.

## Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize automated test generation, coverage analysis, and proactive regression detection as high-value AI features for TQA.
- Build strong security‑testing capabilities (fuzzing, adversarial tests) but require human validation for any fixes.
- Enforce human-in-the-loop gates for release decisions, commits, and acceptance criteria to preserve accountability.
- Deliver verifiable artifacts (logs, screenshots, trace) and clear uncertainty signals; avoid hallucinations and speculative fixes.
- Optimize for speed, low false positives, and tight CI/CD/VCS integration to reduce friction for developers.

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI to automate repetitive testing tasks (unit/E2E/test data) to raise coverage and reduce toil.  
- AI is expected to surface regressions, coverage gaps, and high‑risk change areas—helping shift QA from reactive to preventive.  
- Security and adversarial testing are seen as promising AI use cases, but findings must be verifiable and human‑validated.  
- Major boundaries: AI must not make final release or sign‑off decisions and must not operate as the sole verifier of quality.  
- Tool design must include traceability (logs/screenshots), conservative uncertainty behavior, human approval gates, and fast CI/CD integration.
