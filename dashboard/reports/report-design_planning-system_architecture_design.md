# Thematic Analysis — System Architecture & Design

I reviewed participant responses and extracted only the portions directly addressing System Architecture & Design. I used inductive coding to group similar needs, concerns, and constraints, then synthesized those into coherent themes for where developers want AI help and where they explicitly do not, including cross-cutting patterns, outliers, and practical implications for tool design.

---

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Decision rationale, trade-off analysis, and traceability  
   - Description: Participants want AI to help capture, reason about, and make explicit the rationale behind architectural choices so teams can understand consequences and downstream decisions. This includes tracking why a particular non-functional target (e.g., RPO) was chosen, surfacing child decisions, and showing how small changes ripple through complexity, cost, and performance. They expect AI to provide structured pros/cons, risk-aware proposals, and historical analysis of past bottlenecks to accelerate planning while preserving human oversight. Many stressed that AI should present explainable trade-offs rather than unilaterally deciding.  
   - Number of participants: ~35 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Creation of tracking design decisions ... I would like to reason over the choices that I made, the impact they had..."* (Participant 2)  
     - *"I want AI to help most in streamlining decision-making by providing rationale and trade-offs for design choices..."* (Participant 267)  
     - *"Requirement breakdown and pros/cons analysis given a set of guardrails."* (Participant 111)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Documentation, diagrams, and design artifact automation  
   - Description: Many developers want AI to take meeting notes, transcripts, or feature descriptions and generate concrete artifacts—design documents, architecture diagrams, task lists, and starter repositories—so that humans can iterate faster. The appeal is reducing clerical toil (diagram drawing, doc drafting, task creation) and producing consistent artifacts tied to team conventions. Participants expect AI to automate routine artifact creation while remaining steerable and editable.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Help crafting design documents along with building architecture diagrams from the description of the features"* (Participant 55)  
     - *"I would love for AI to take a proof-of-concept code change and generate a design doc based on it"* (Participant 121)  
     - *"Create diagrams from bullet points or one-pagers."* (Participant 386)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: System comprehension and internal context ingestion  
   - Description: Developers want AI that can accurately ingest and reason over existing codebases, APIs, contracts, and org-specific constraints so suggestions are grounded in the team's reality. This includes extracting internal context, surfacing dependencies, recognizing reusable components, and generating design suggestions that reflect the current system rather than generic patterns. Accurate understanding of the codebase and organizational constraints is treated as a prerequisite for useful design assistance.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Being able to fully understand the codebase and collect internal context."* (Participant 135)  
     - *"The ability to look at multiple code bases, contracts and API calls, to help understand how to add/extend functionality"* (Participant 201)  
     - *"AI should understand the existing system and then make suggestions during requirement gathering and analysis."* (Participant 281)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Ideation—exploring alternative architectures, patterns, and options  
   - Description: Participants want AI as a creative collaborator that proposes realistic alternative architectures, pattern suggestions, and fresh ideas they might not have considered. The desired outcome is broader, more informed decision space and reduced tunnel vision; AI should propose multiple steerable options with pros/cons rather than a single fixed solution. This role emphasizes inspiration and breadth while leaving final choice to humans.  
   - Number of participants: ~40 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Design seems like a great use of AI."* (Participant 79)  
     - *"Provide suggestions for satisfying non-functional requirements such as scalability, reliability..."* (Participant 272)  
     - *"AI can really open the doors for finding different approaches to solving a problem..."* (Participant 387)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 5. Theme: Technology selection and non-functional trade-off evaluation  
   - Description: Several participants asked for AI help in evaluating technology choices and non-functional concerns (scalability, reliability, cost, horizontal vs vertical scaling, managed vs self-hosted services). They expect AI to analyze constraints, call out dependencies, and present detailed pros/cons grounded in projected loads and costs, helping reduce rework and speed up technology decision-making. Boundaries include the need for guardrails and human confirmation for organization-specific choices.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"evaluate tradeoffs in design considerations (which azure technologies to use, whether to scale horizontally or vertically, etc)"* (Participant 66)  
     - *"Do I go with Azure Managed Redis, or do I self-host Redis OSS to save on costs? What are the detailed pros/cons?"* (Participant 111)  
     - *"AI should be suggesting optimal architectural patterns and recommending infrastructure choices based on projected load and cost constraints."* (Participant 309)  
   - Confidence: High

---

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Owning final or critical architectural decisions and accountability  
   - Description: A strong and recurring boundary is that AI should not be the primary owner of critical architectural decisions or be relied upon to make final trade-offs that carry long-term consequences. Participants emphasized that architecture involves hard-to-change commitments requiring human investment, accountability, long-term vision, and organizational context; they want AI to be an assistant or sounding board, not the decision-maker. Many require explicit human review and final sign-off.  
   - Number of participants: ~45 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don’t want AI to own critical architectural decisions or trade-offs, as these require deep domain knowledge, long-term vision, and accountability..."* (Participant 241)  
     - *"I don't want it as the primary creator of system architecture. I think humans with experience are still the best for that..."* (Participant 193)  
     - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle the parts ... that involve intuition, judgment, or team dynamics."* (Participant 301)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Accuracy, hallucination risk, and lack of trustworthy correctness  
   - Description: Many developers fear AI hallucinations, incorrect suggestions, or incomplete understanding that could send teams down non-viable paths and cause production issues. This theme centers on trust: participants want AI outputs to be accurate, provable, and traceable before they will rely on them for architecture. Several cited prior experiences where AI produced plausible but wrong guidance and stressed that the cost of architectural mistakes is high.  
   - Number of participants: ~30 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"When it hallucinates and sends inexperienced/uneducated developers down non-viable paths, it's a big problem..."* (Participant 53)  
     - *"It might not be accurate or up to date when it comes to new technology..."* (Participant 204)  
     - *"If AI continues to look anything like what it looks like right now, none of these tasks are sufficiently structured for AI to be able to do."* (Participant 357)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Bias toward canned/default patterns and reduced innovation  
   - Description: Several participants worry AI will default to familiar or historic patterns rather than novel, context-appropriate solutions; this could bias designs toward “known” approaches and miss modern or better-fitting alternatives. They fear AI may encourage uniformity and suboptimal choices that don't account for team-specific practices or long-term maintainability.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"System design is probably the thing I want it to handle the least because I would be worried it would bias towards old known solutions..."* (Participant 188)  
     - *"Gen AI would probably fallback to using the same known pattern regardless of the design particularities."* (Participant 345)  
     - *"There is nothing where I don't want AI. The closest ... I don't want it to be fully autonomous."* (Participant 70) — illustrating desire to avoid autonomous defaulting.  
   - Confidence: Medium

#### 4. Theme: Human-centered tasks—vision-setting, stakeholder alignment, empathy, and context-sensitive requirements gathering  
   - Description: Many respondents said AI should not lead activities that require human empathy, negotiation, sensing of team dynamics, or stakeholder alignment. They see requirements elicitation, vision-setting, and nuanced team decisions as inherently human tasks; AI can support by summarizing or recommending but not by owning those interactions or judgments. This reflects concerns about losing human accountability and the social skills required to set product direction.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle creative vision-setting or stakeholder alignment in design and planning activities."* (Participant 9)  
     - *"Handling any kind of human-driven scenarios should be left to human beings. Things like requirements gathering ... should be primarily driven by humans."* (Participant 149)  
     - *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle final decision-making on design trade-offs or team dynamics..."* (Participant 403)  
   - Confidence: High

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Alignment between wants and don't-wants: Developers consistently want AI to reduce toil (docs, diagrams, artifact generation), help analyze trade-offs, and expand ideation, but they also insist AI remain advisory rather than authoritative. The same features desired (trade-off analysis, alternative proposals) are simultaneously feared if delivered without provenance, context, or human-in-the-loop controls.
- Tensions and contradictions: There are polarized views—some participants want AI to handle the "bulk" of architecture (e.g., Participant 168), while others reject any substantive AI role until accuracy improves (Participant 357). The primary tension is between speed/scale (AI can explore many options quickly) and accountability/accuracy (human expertise ensures long-term maintainability).
- Conditions and boundaries developers place on AI usage: Common conditions are (1) accurate ingestion of internal context (codebases, org rules), (2) explainability and traceability of recommendations, (3) guardrails and steering so outputs follow team conventions, and (4) explicit human sign-off for high-stakes or long-lived architectural choices.

### Relation to other tasks
- Participants often contrasted System Architecture & Design with Requirements Gathering & Analysis and coding: many want AI to assist more in architecture than to fully replace human-led requirements gathering or final design choices. Several specifically requested AI help in design documentation and code-starter generation, while insisting requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment remain human-led.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Pro-AI maximalists: A small number want AI to do "all" architecture work or act as the primary architect (Participant 7: "All should be done by AI!", Participant 168: "AI should handle the bulk..."). These are outliers relative to the dominant human-in-the-loop preference.
- Strong skeptics: Some participants fundamentally distrust current AI capabilities for architecture because of error rates and high cost of mistakes (Participant 357 strongly opposes current AI usage for design).
- Mixed signals on requirements: A few participants simultaneously wanted AI to assist with requirements analysis (e.g., Participant 10, 12) while also saying requirements gathering should be human-led—showing nuance that some parts of requirements work are seen as automatable (analysis/synthesis) while elicitation remains human.
- Org-specific constraints: Several responders emphasized AI must respect organizational conventions (e.g., using specific UI libraries or internal components), which is a unique operational requirement that some tools may not handle.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers welcome AI as a collaborator that speeds ideation, reduces clerical work, and surfaces trade-offs—provided its outputs are accurate, context-aware, explainable, and remain under human control. Tools must prioritize ingestion of internal context and transparent rationale while avoiding autonomous ownership of long-term architectural decisions.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Context ingestion and provenance
  - Capability: Deeply ingest codebases, API contracts, organizational constraints, and historical decisions; surface sources and evidence for any recommendation. Rationale: prevents hallucinations and ensures suggestions are grounded in reality.
- Trade-off reasoning and explainability
  - Capability: Present multiple options with explicit pros/cons, costs, performance implications, and decision trees linking high-level requirements to child decisions. Rationale: supports human decision-making and traceability.
- Artifact automation and templating
  - Capability: Generate design docs, diagrams (editable), and task lists from meeting notes, POCs, or requirements templates while adhering to team conventions. Rationale: reduces repetitive work and standardizes outputs.
- Steering, guardrails, and customization
  - Capability: Allow teams to set organizational guardrails (preferred libraries, compliance constraints), tune risk appetite, and restrict autonomous actions. Rationale: keeps outputs aligned to team needs and mitigates bias toward generic patterns.
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
  - Capability: Make approval explicit for any critical decision, support collaborative review, and track decision ownership. Rationale: preserves accountability and reduces risk of regressive architectural choices.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous finalization of critical architecture
  - Anti-pattern: Allowing AI to make and apply irreversible architectural decisions without human sign-off. Rationale: architecture requires long-term accountability and human judgment.
- Opaque recommendations without evidence
  - Anti-pattern: Producing confident-sounding suggestions with no traceable sources or contextual justification. Rationale: harms trust and increases risk of bad decisions.
- One-size-fits-all default patterns
  - Anti-pattern: Recommending the same canonical architecture regardless of team context or constraints. Rationale: encourages suboptimal, non-contextual designs.

Optional design patterns to resolve tensions
- "Suggestion + Evidence" cards: Every recommendation includes a short rationale, estimated impact, linked evidence (code snippet, doc, benchmark), and a suggested human reviewer.
- "Design sandbox" mode: Allow AI to generate multiple divergent architectures as lightweight prototypes (diagrams + cost/load estimates) that teams can iterate on, without touching production artifacts until human approval.

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to accelerate architecture work in specific, advisory ways: capture decision rationale, analyze trade-offs, generate docs/diagrams, and suggest realistic alternative architectures while respecting internal context.
- The strongest boundary is accountability: AI must not own final architectural decisions or high-stakes trade-offs—humans want explicit sign-off and responsibility.
- Trust is a prerequisite: hallucination risk, stale knowledge, and lack of provenance are major barriers to adopting AI for architectural tasks.
- Practical features to prioritize: deep internal context ingestion, explainable trade-off analysis, artifact generation (docs/diagrams), steering/guardrails, and clear human-in-the-loop workflows.
- Avoid making AI autonomous in architecture, opaque in reasoning, or biased toward canned patterns; instead provide evidence-backed, customizable, and reviewable suggestions.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Build AI to augment—not replace—architects: focus on trade-offs, documentation, and context-aware suggestions.
- Require provenance and evidence for every architectural recommendation to build trust.
- Provide team-level guardrails and customization so outputs reflect organizational practices.
- Keep final decision-making and stakeholder alignment firmly human-led; use AI as a structured collaborator.
- Offer multi-option explorations rather than single prescriptive solutions to avoid rut-like bias.
