# Thematic Analysis — Client/Stakeholder Communication (e.g. email, meetings)

I reviewed each participant’s responses and extracted only the portions explicitly about client/stakeholder communication (emails, meetings, summaries, scheduling, note-taking, and related stakeholder updates). I coded recurring intents, concerns, and constraints, grouped them into coherent themes for where developers want AI support and where they do not, and synthesized cross‑cutting patterns and design implications.

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Meeting summarization and recaps  
   - Description: Participants repeatedly asked for AI to take notes, transcribe meetings, and generate concise recaps so they can catch up quickly and reduce cognitive load. This covers missed‑meeting recaps, synthesizing discussion points, surfacing decisions and follow-ups, and producing artifacts that can be shared with stakeholders. The motivation is efficiency and preserving context in fast‑moving initiatives; the desired outcome is accurate, editable summaries that save time and improve alignment. Many added the boundary that outputs should be reviewable and editable (not blindly trusted) and that AI should not autonomously replace live human follow‑ups.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"The killer Copilot feature for me is Recap, allowing me to quickly catch up on meetings I missed."* (Participant 198)  
     - *"Summarizing meetings and communication..."* (Participant 217)  
     - *"transcription, summaries"* (Participant 385)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Drafting, rephrasing and multilingual assistance for emails/messages  
   - Description: Developers want AI to help craft clearer, audience‑tailored messages—rephrasing technical details for non‑technical stakeholders, suggesting tone and formality (including language‑specific honorifics), and offering translations or corrections without changing intent. The motivation is reducing the time and friction of composing messages and ensuring correct, respectful phrasing across cultures. The expected outcome is draft suggestions and phrasing helpers that preserve the author’s voice and require human approval before sending. Boundaries include no wholesale rewriting that reinterprets meaning and no fully autonomous outbound messaging.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"rephrase words to stakeholders or client - chat message or emails. help to explain the tech details ... in an easy understandable way"* (Participant 127)  
     - *"I want AI suggestions for communication with external partners, particularly when I'm writing in Japanese ..."* (Participant 175)  
     - *"Communicating with customers."* (Participant 200)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Scheduling, administrative follow‑ups and repetitive messaging  
   - Description: Several respondents requested AI handling of low‑value, repetitive coordination work—scheduling meetings, inserting calendar invites with links/rooms, responding to routine emails, and sending simple follow‑ups. The motivation is to remove toil and free time for higher‑value work. Desired outcomes are reliable automation for predictable tasks and one‑click confirmations for follow‑ups. Boundaries include retaining control (AI should not send without user verification) and ensuring accuracy of invites/participants.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Meeting scheduling. Here is a list of names put a meeting on the calendar with a room and Teams link."* (Participant 50)  
     - *"It should be able to respond to repetitive emails, take notes, take easy follow-ups (send emails, set up meetings, etc)."* (Participant 357)  
     - *"send me a draft for proof reading"* (Participant 72 — re: reports but implies review before send)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Automated progress reports and documentation tied to stakeholder updates  
   - Description: Participants want AI to compile project progress, produce status reports, and generate documentation (including deriving docs from code) that can be used in stakeholder updates, onboarding, and announcements. The motivation is saving time on recurring reporting and improving traceability and onboarding quality. The desired outcome is accurate, referenceable reports and documentation drafts that can be finalized by humans. Boundaries include explicit human approval before distribution and concern about AI hallucinations in authoritative documents.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"automatically generate progress reports using my ADOs and send me a draft for proof reading"* (Participant 72)  
     - *"writing communications" / "automating documentation"* (Participants 164, 403)  
     - *"writing effective documentation, and communicating all announcements to partners and stakeholder communication for regular updates, with human supervision."* (Participant 271)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 5. Theme: Personal agent / proactive stakeholder tracking and triage  
   - Description: A subset of developers envision an AI "personal agent" that monitors project state, surfaces relevant stakeholder context, flags questions for the user, and in some cases attends meetings or answers straightforward queries on the user's behalf. The motivation is continuous alignment and reducing the meta‑work of deciding what to communicate and when. Desired outcomes include proactive prompts, aggregated context, and limited delegated actions under human oversight. Many stressed that such agents should have configurable autonomy levels and require human sign‑off for sensitive actions.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Be my personal agent. Keep track my work and thoughts and be able to attend meetings or answer some questions on my behalf."* (Participant 204)  
     - *"delegate the task of updating my stakeholders to an AI assistant and it can keep them informed..."* (Participant 117)  
     - *"tell where the project goes and where to go and what I should do today (email, ping someone), based on the information it collects."* (Participant 232)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: No autonomous outbound messaging — human-in‑the‑loop required  
   - Description: A strong and recurring constraint is that AI should not send emails or communicate with stakeholders without explicit human review and approval. Participants fear loss of control, unintended tone or errors, and accountability gaps if AI acts autonomously. The desired boundary is always showing drafts to the human owner and requiring sign‑off before any external communication or distribution. This applies both to routine emails and to documentation generated from AI.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want it to send emails on my behalf without me proof reading first."* (Participant 72)  
     - *"Shouldn't send an email without my permission/viewing it first."* (Participant 102)  
     - *"I don't want AI directly communicating on my behalf."* (Participant 123)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Preserve human touch for sensitive, high‑stakes, and relationship‑building communications  
   - Description: Participants expressed that client and stakeholder communications that require empathy, trust, prioritization trade‑offs, or relationship building should remain human responsibilities. They worry AI could damage rapport, mishandle political nuance, or misjudge priorities. The feared outcome is loss of authenticity, trust, and mismanaged expectations; the boundary is that AI may assist (e.g., drafts or summaries) but not replace direct human engagement for sensitive interactions.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I donâ€™t want AI to handle sensitive stakeholder communications or prioritization trade-offs, as these require empathy, trust-building, and nuanced understanding of team dynamics."* (Participant 172)  
     - *"Client communication needs to have a personal touch."* (Participant 217)  
     - *"I don't think AI should be handling communication with stakeholders"* (Participant 188)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Accuracy, hallucination and accountability concerns (documentation, mentoring, onboarding)  
   - Description: Several participants warned that AI hallucinations and inaccuracies make it risky to rely on AI for authoritative documentation, mentoring, or as the primary source of stakeholder‑facing content. They fear spreading incorrect information, eroding accountability, and undermining learning. The boundary is limited use for drafting and summarization with rigorous human verification before those outputs inform stakeholder decisions or mentoring.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should definitely not be the primary factor in documentation, communication, or mentoring/onboarding. Its tendency to hallucinate is too great to risk..."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"I'm hesistant to mentor someone based on AI"* (Participant 123)  
     - *"If I expect a human to read it, I'm going to take the time to write it myself."* (Participant 167)  
   - Confidence: Medium

#### 4. Theme: Confidentiality and handling of sensitive or proprietary client data  
   - Description: Some participants explicitly rejected AI involvement when communications contain confidential or sensitive content. They worry about privacy, data exfiltration, and model exposure of client information. The desired boundary is strict controls or complete exclusion of AI from communications that process confidential data, or at least clear data‑governance guarantees before any AI involvement.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants (rounded to nearest 5)  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Client/Stakeholder Communication as its risky in terms for privacy."* (Participant 180)  
     - *"to handle confidentional data"* (Participant 329)  
     - *"communication with the client and stakeholders. AI should suggests what can be done"* (Participant 332 — implies restricted role)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Efficiency vs. control: Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive, time‑consuming tasks (summaries, scheduling, draft phrasing) but repeatedly insist on human oversight before anything is sent externally. The dominant pattern is "AI as assistant, not autonomous agent."
- Role and identity alignment: Communication tasks tied to relationship‑building, mentorship, or judgment (prioritization, sensitive client discussions) are seen as identity‑aligned human work that AI should not supplant. Conversely, rote tasks that conflict with developers’ desire to focus on engineering are prime candidates for AI assistance.
- Accuracy and accountability concerns shape acceptable use: hallucination risk, provenance, and traceability were cited as reasons to limit AI to draft and summarizing roles, with final accountability remaining human.
- Graduated autonomy: Participants favored configurable autonomy—AI can draft, suggest, summarize, or act as an agent only under explicit, user‑defined permission levels.
- Boundaries depend on data sensitivity: Use is more acceptable for internal summaries and scheduling than for external, confidential client communications.

Relation to other tasks
- Several participants directly linked client/stakeholder communication to documentation and onboarding, asking for the same safeguards (human sign‑off) and expressing similar concerns about hallucinations and loss of human touch.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Full autonomy advocates: A few participants (e.g., Participant 7 and Participant 23 said "All aspects"/"Everything") expressed minimal restrictions, wanting AI to handle broad communication tasks; these views are a small minority.
- Full rejection of AI drafting: At the other extreme, some participants (e.g., Participant 167, Participant 175) categorically refuse AI‑written emails or docs because of authenticity concerns.
- Agent that attends/answers on behalf: Participant 204 explicitly requested an AI that could attend meetings and answer questions — a higher autonomy request that most others conditioned on oversight.
- Cultural/language nuance: Participant 175 requested very focused, culture‑specific guidance (Japanese honorifics), showing value in niche language support rather than wholesale translation.
- Role delegation: Participant 268 suggested client communication should be handled by PMs, pointing to organizational variation in who should use AI for these tasks.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want tools that remove low‑value work while preserving human control, authenticity, and accountability in stakeholder interactions. Design must prioritize transparent, reviewable outputs, configurable autonomy, and strong data governance.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Human-in‑the‑loop approval workflows  
  - Drafts must be presented for explicit approval before sending; “preview & send” and mandatory sign‑off features prevent unwanted autonomous outbound messages. Rationale: widely demanded constraint to retain control and accountability.
- Reliable meeting capture and editable recaps  
  - High‑quality transcription, decision/action extraction, and editable summaries with source links and timestamps. Rationale: frequent demand to catch up and share meeting outcomes.
- Tone/style and audience tailoring controls (including multilingual nuance)  
  - Tools that suggest phrasing, formality, and cultural conventions without altering intent; allow toggling between preserving author voice and strong editing. Rationale: users want assistance but not reinterpretation.
- Scheduling and follow‑up automation with confirmations  
  - Auto‑fill invites, propose times, prepare follow‑up drafts that require one‑click user confirmation. Rationale: repetitive coordination is high ROI and low risk when user controls final send.
- Data governance, access controls and privacy safeguards  
  - Role‑based permissions to exclude confidential communications from AI processing, on‑prem/enterprise model options, and clear provenance for generated content. Rationale: confidentiality concerns mandate strict controls.
- Provenance and fact‑checking aids  
  - Source citations, links to artifacts (tickets, code), and confidence indicators for generated statements. Rationale: minimizes hallucination risk when outputs are used for stakeholder communication.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autonomous sending of stakeholder communications without explicit human approval. Rationale: breaks accountability and is broadly unacceptable.
- Rewriting that changes author intent or voice, especially for cross‑cultural / high‑stakes messages. Rationale: undermines authenticity and trust.
- Reliance on opaque external models for confidential client data without contractual/technical protections. Rationale: privacy and compliance risk.
- Using AI as the sole source for mentoring/onboarding content without human validation. Rationale: risks propagating incorrect guidance and reduces relational learning.

Design patterns to resolve tensions
- Graduated autonomy: allow admins/users to configure per‑task autonomy levels (draft-only, suggest+queue, or send-with-approval).  
- Audit trail and editable provenance: every AI‑generated line links to source data and an editable provenance panel that documents why the AI made a claim.  
- Locked contexts for sensitive communications: the system can automatically disallow AI processing for messages tagged as confidential or designated client data.

## Short Summary / Recommendations

- Prioritize assistive features that save time on repetitive, meta‑work: meeting recaps, scheduling, follow‑ups, and draft suggestions. Always require user review before external send.
- Implement explicit human‑in‑the‑loop controls and configurable autonomy per task and per recipient (internal vs external, confidential vs public).
- Provide provenance, citations, and confidence indicators in summaries and drafts to reduce hallucination risk and support accountability.
- Offer fine‑grained privacy controls (e.g., opt‑out for confidential clients, on‑premise options) and role‑based permissions for communications.
- Support tone/style controls and targeted multilingual guidance (cultural formality), but avoid wholesale rewriting that could change intent or voice.
- Avoid designs that enable fully autonomous AI‑led stakeholder outreach without robust approvals, auditability, and organizational governance.
- Design for configurability: different teams (e.g., PMs vs engineers) and communication contexts require different levels of AI intervention.

## Executive Summary

- Developers welcome AI for time‑saving, repeatable communication tasks: meeting recaps, note‑taking, scheduling, and draft suggestions.  
- Strong, consistent requirement: AI must not send external communications without human review and explicit approval.  
- Sensitive, high‑stakes, or relationship‑building communications should remain human‑led; AI may assist but not replace judgment or empathy.  
- Top design needs: human‑in‑the‑loop workflows, provenance/citations, privacy controls, and tone/language assist that preserves author intent.  
- Guardrails: no autonomous outbound messaging, no opaque handling of confidential data, and no sole reliance on AI for mentoring/onboarding materials.
