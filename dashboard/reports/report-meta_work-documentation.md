# Thematic Analysis — Documentation

I reviewed participant responses and extracted only the portions that directly reference Documentation. I used an inductive thematic approach: coding recurring ideas about what developers want AI to do for documentation, what they explicitly don’t want AI to do, and the conditions or limits they attach to its use. Themes reflect task value (time saved, reducing toil), identity/accountability (ownership of final content), and cognitive demands (accuracy, traceability, contextual understanding).

## 1) Core Themes


### A. Where AI is wanted

#### 1. Theme: Auto‑generation and continuous maintenance of documentation from code and development artifacts  
   - Description: Many developers want AI to automatically produce and keep documentation in sync with code, PRs, tests and architectural artifacts so that documentation exists and stays current without heavy manual effort. The motivation is reducing repetitive, low‑value work and closing the common gap where docs are missing or outdated; the desired outcome is accurate, context‑aware “what” documentation (API surface, usage examples, diagrams) generated from source artifacts. Participants commonly set a boundary that outputs should be reviewed and not treated as the single source of truth until verified.  
   - Number of participants: ~45 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Having AI help create and maintain documentation based on checked-in code, PRs, tests, etc would be a game changer for documentation"* (Participant 27)  
     - *"Generating documentation as I work would save me so much time"* (Participant 123)  
     - *"Automatic documentation updates based on code changes."* (Participant 262)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: Summarization, review and validation to keep docs accurate and concise  
   - Description: Developers want AI to review existing docs, flag inconsistencies, summarize long technical documents, and suggest edits so documentation quality and usefulness improve. Motivation includes reducing cognitive load when onboarding or researching and ensuring documentation reflects the current system. Desired outcomes include concise summaries, discrepancy detection, and suggested corrections; common constraints are that humans must validate changes because AI can hallucinate or miss “why” explanations.  
   - Number of participants: ~25 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Documentation validation, and suggestions for changes to our service taking into account new technology options."* (Participant 54)  
     - *"Documentation seems like a good use case as long as there is detailed review of the output, as hallucinations are common."* (Participant 66)  
     - *"Find issues in documentation."* (Participant 148)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Discovery and contextual search (making docs and answers easier to find)  
   - Description: Participants want AI to act as a smarter search or knowledge‑discovery layer that surfaces authoritative documentation, internal context, and relevant snippets quickly. The motivation is reducing time lost hunting through poorly organized docs and internal repositories; the desired outcome is faster problem resolution and learning. Conditions include the need for traceability to sources and handling of internal permissions/terminology carefully.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Searching documentation and code repositories hasn't usually worked well... improvements in learning in this space would be helpful."* (Participant 47)  
     - *"Coalescing relevant documentation and making answers easier to find."* (Participant 206)  
     - *"use as a 'smart' search engine to help discover relevant information, ideally directing to accurate (non-ai) references/documentation/etc"* (Participant 187)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Onboarding, training materials, meeting summaries and meta‑work tied to documentation  
   - Description: AI is seen as useful for generating onboarding guides, training plans, progress reports, meeting notes and documenting decisions to lower coordination overhead. Motivation includes accelerating new‑hire ramp and reducing the burden of producing cross‑team artifacts; expected outcomes are draftable materials and summaries that humans can refine. Boundaries include keeping humans in the loop for communications that affect people or contractual commitments.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Assist in onboarding, documentation and learning new technologies"* (Participant 157)  
     - *"automatically generate progress reports... send me a draft for proofreading"* (Participant 72)  
     - *"Walkthrough onboarding process"* (Participant 375)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 5. Theme: Boilerplate, first‑drafts and reducing documentation toil  
   - Description: Developers welcome AI creating boilerplate, initial drafts, inline comments and diagrams so engineers can focus on higher‑value decisions. The motivation is that many engineers avoid or deprioritize documentation because it’s tedious; desired outcome is a useful starting point that speeds authoring. Constraints frequently stated are that AI handles the rote parts while humans supply rationale, nuance, and finalize content.  
   - Number of participants: ~20 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Auto-documentation of 'what' would be great... it could be a great tool for creating first draft documentation."* (Participant 165)  
     - *"I want it to write documentation"* (Participant 85)  
     - *"Copilot is helpful for writing and suggesting code documentation and inline code comments."* (Participant 353)  
   - Confidence: High

### B. Where AI is not wanted

#### 1. Theme: Unsupervised authority is unacceptable — hallucination and trust concerns  
   - Description: A common concern is that AI hallucinates or fabricates details, so developers explicitly don’t want AI to be the authoritative source for documentation without human validation. The context is final, human‑facing documentation and technical decisions; the concern is misinformation causing bugs, miscommunication, or onboarding errors. The feared outcome is incorrect docs being consumed as truth; many participants insist on human review, provenance/citations, or limiting AI to draft‑level output.  
   - Number of participants: ~15 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Its tendency to hallucinate is too great to risk in these areas without significant human oversight."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"I don't trust a stochastic parrot to be capable of getting it right"* (Participant 385)  
     - *"Documentation seems like a good use case as long as there is detailed review of the output, as hallucinations are common."* (Participant 66)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 2. Theme: No autonomous publishing or communication — require human approval and control  
   - Description: Participants do not want AI to autonomously publish, send, or share documentation or related communications. The context includes emails, announcements, and any operation that distributes documentation to stakeholders; the concern is loss of control, accidental sharing of incorrect or sensitive content, and bypassing human sign‑off. The feared outcome is automated, unreviewed publication that creates downstream coordination or security problems. Many demanded explicit preview/approval workflows.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"I don't want it to send emails on my behalf without me proofreading first. Same applies to the documentation generated by the AI; I don't want it to send those documents... without my approval."* (Participant 72)  
     - *"I wouldn't want AI to be entirely autonomous. There should still be varying levels of human oversight depending on the task."* (Participant 204)  
     - *"It can also help... with human supervision."* (Participant 271)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 3. Theme: Not a replacement for mentoring, nuanced docs, or human‑authored, high‑stakes communication  
   - Description: Several participants said AI should not replace human mentoring, onboarding relationships, or carefully crafted documentation intended for human audiences where tone, nuance, and judgment matter. The context is interpersonal learning and high‑stakes or sensitive documentation; the concern is loss of personal connection, missed learning opportunities, and subtlety that AI may miss. The feared outcome is degraded onboarding quality or misaligned communication; many want AI to assist but not supplant humans in these roles.  
   - Number of participants: ~10 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"AI should definitely not be the primary factor in documentation, communication, or mentoring/onboarding."* (Participant 17)  
     - *"If I expect a human to read it, I'm going to take the time to write it myself."* (Participant 167)  
     - *"Filling out details of documentation (I don't trust a stochastic parrot to be capable of getting it right)... mentoring and onboarding (building the personal connection is the point!!)"* (Participant 385)  
   - Confidence: High

#### 4. Theme: Limitations with internal docs, permissions, and domain‑specific terminology  
   - Description: A smaller group called out that AI struggles with internal documentation retrieval, access/permission boundaries, and ambiguous internal naming, so they don't want AI to be relied on where it can't access essential context. The concern is incomplete or misleading answers when AI cannot see private/internal resources or misunderstands local taxonomy; the feared outcome is incomplete or incorrect documentation and wasted effort.  
   - Number of participants: ~5 participants  
   - Representative quotes:  
     - *"Internal documentation retrieval... internal docs have a lot of permission barriers. AI cannot get all related information, and some terminology can be misleading for AI."* (Participant 232)  
     - *"Searching documentation and code repositories hasn't usually worked well when using copilot..."* (Participant 47)  
     - *"When the related knowledge is not included, it can't handle it."* (Participant 327)  
   - Confidence: Medium

## 2) Cross‑Cutting Patterns

- Connections between wants and don't‑wants: Developers strongly want AI to reduce repetitive documentation toil (auto‑generate, summarize, keep docs current) but insist that AI outputs be provisional drafts with clear provenance. The desire for automation coexists with a need for human ownership and review.
- Tensions/contradictions: There is tension between maximizing automation (auto‑publish, auto‑update) and control/accuracy requirements (no autonomous publishing). Many participants want continuous updates but simultaneously reject fully autonomous workflows — they prefer draft‑and‑approve models.
- Conditions and boundaries: Commonly stated boundaries are: require citations/provenance, show confidence/uncertainty, keep humans in the approval loop, avoid replacing human mentoring or final human‑facing documentation, and respect permissions for internal data.

### Relation to other tasks
- Several participants contrasted documentation with other tasks (research, code generation, onboarding). They often treated documentation as lower‑risk for AI assistance than mentorship or final customer communication, but still demanded verification and provenance.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Broadly enthusiastic participants: A few participants answered "All aspects!" or "Everything" (Participants 7 and 23), indicating a small subset is comfortable with aggressive AI involvement in documentation without explicit caveats.
- Reluctant participants: Participant 189 explicitly said they do not find AI useful for documentation — an outlier against the general positive tilt.
- Mixed responses: Some participants welcomed AI for search/discovery but explicitly refused AI‑authored final docs or emails (Participant 167). This hybrid stance is informative: accept AI as an assistant, not an authorizer.
- Access/permissions edge cases: Participant 232 highlights a domain where AI can actively harm by presenting incomplete internal context if permissioned data is missing — an operational edge case warranting special design attention.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI to be a productivity multiplier for documentation but demand clear provenance, accuracy signals, and human control. Tools should prioritize reliable extraction from code and artifacts, provide traceable sources, and enforce human approval before publishing or sending documentation externally.

#### Key "must haves" (features designers should prioritize)
- Code‑to‑doc generation with diffs and PR integration
  - Capability: Generate documentation drafts from code/PRs/tests and present changes as reviewable diffs (so reviewers can accept/modify before merging). Rationale: aligns automated updates with existing developer workflows and preserves human oversight.
- Provenance, citations, and confidence indicators
  - Capability: Show exact source references (file, commit, test) and a confidence score or uncertainty markers for generated statements. Rationale: reduces hallucination risks and helps reviewers verify claims quickly.
- Approve/publish workflow and explicit human sign‑off
  - Capability: Draft → review → publish pipeline with no automatic external distribution unless approved; audit trail of who approved. Rationale: prevents accidental sharing and preserves accountability.
- Permission‑aware search and connectors to internal systems
  - Capability: Respect internal access controls, show when results are partial due to permission restrictions, and surface authoritative internal docs first. Rationale: avoids misleading answers when context is missing.
- Summarization and validation tools
  - Capability: Automated summarization, doc‑consistency checks, and suggested fixes with links to code/tests. Rationale: reduces toil and helps maintain accuracy while highlighting where human input is needed.

#### Key "must not haves" (design guardrails)
- Autopublish/autosend without explicit human approval
  - Rationale: participants explicitly reject autonomous dissemination of documentation or emails.
- Presenting generated text as authoritative without sources
  - Rationale: hallucination risk; AI should not be allowed to overwrite or be treated as canonical without provenance.
- Replacing human mentoring or final, nuanced documentation
  - Rationale: onboarding and mentoring have interpersonal elements and pedagogical value that AI should assist but not substitute.

(Optional design pattern to resolve tensions)
- Human‑in‑the‑loop “Draft + Verify” pattern: AI generates drafts, annotates claims with links, flags low‑confidence items, and gates publishing behind reviewer acceptance and an approval button.

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly want AI to generate, maintain, and summarize documentation to reduce repetitive work and keep docs current, especially when derived from code, PRs, and tests.  
- They want better discovery: smarter, permission‑aware search and surfacing of authoritative docs and snippets.  
- Strong, recurring concerns are hallucination and accuracy; participants insist on provenance/citations and human validation before treating AI output as truth.  
- Designers must prevent autonomous publishing: drafts are fine, but explicit human approval is required before sharing or sending documentation.  
- AI is acceptable for boilerplate, first drafts, and meta‑work (onboarding materials, meeting summaries) but not as a replacement for human mentoring or nuanced, final human‑facing documentation.

Short Summary / Recommendations

- Build code‑to‑doc pipelines that surface proposed changes as reviewable diffs tied to PRs.  
- Always show source links and confidence levels for generated doc content.  
- Require explicit human approval for publishing or external distribution of documentation.  
- Make search permission‑aware and surface internal authoritative sources first; warn when context is missing.  
- Use AI to create drafts, summaries, and validation checks while preserving human ownership of final content.
