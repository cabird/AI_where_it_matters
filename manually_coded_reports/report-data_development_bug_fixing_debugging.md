# Report of Qualitative Analysis for Bug Fixing Debugging (Category: Development)

This report is an AI-generated synthesis of manually coded survey responses about AI usage in Bug Fixing Debugging within Development. I preserved the research team's thematic structure and codes, integrated representative participant quotes, and analyzed patterns, tensions, and design implications. The approach was to synthesize code descriptions and participant excerpts into coherent narratives that highlight where developers want AI support, where they resist it, and what design guardrails are necessary.

## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency / Rote Task Automation

Participants consistently want AI to shoulder tedious, low-value, or repetitive aspects of debugging so engineers can concentrate on higher-order problem solving and creativity. The researchers described this theme as "AI takes over tedious or low-value bug-related tasks (e.g., setup, log gathering, searching related fixes) so developers can focus on creative, high-value work." Respondents framed desired outcomes as time savings and cognitive-load reduction: for example, delegating "repetitive grunge work" or "time-consuming tasks that require low cognitive load, freeing me up for tasks that require a higher cognitive load" (Participant 319; Participant 365). Practical requests include automating scaffolding (code templates), log analytics, cache invalidation, and straightforward refactors so humans can own the design and complex debugging.

Boundaries appear in the emphasis that AI should not replace the fun or skilled parts entirely—developers want offloading of "non-interesting, rote work" while preserving core engineering roles. Several participants tied efficiency gains to developer velocity rather than wholesale replacement: "Generating code templates can help bootstrap projects and increase developer velocity" (Participant 369). The desired outcome is a hybrid workflow where AI reduces grunt labor but leaves critical decisions and creative debugging to people.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Having AI do a lot of repetitive grunge work. Leave me to do the fun coding ;-)"* (Participant 319)
- *"Automating time-consuming tasks that require low cognitive load, freeing me up for tasks that require a higher cognitive load."* (Participant 365)
- *"Helping with repetitive tasks"* (Participant 98)

#### Theme: Comprehension & Collaboration Support       - (Collaborative Debugging)

Within this theme, participants want AI to act as an interactive partner that suggests likely issues, catches simple errors, and helps explain reasoning without taking full control. The research description—"AI should work alongside the developer as a partner, suggesting possible issues and solutions without fully taking over"—captures a strong preference for assistive, conversational behavior: "I want AI to point out where I could be wrong or identify potential problems ... not do everything for me based off of a one-sentence prompt. I thought we were building a Copilot not an AI Servant" (Participant 89). Developers see value in AI confirming algorithmic correctness, catching typos, and surfacing relevant examples or definitions so they don't context-switch to external resources: "Act like an assistant to reaffirm correctness ... and catch typos or simple bugs" (Participant 160).

The desired modality is collaborative and conservative: the AI should ask clarifying questions, explain its reasoning, and limit changes to what the developer intends ("understand the target and do ONLY what I want" — Participant 256). Participants explicitly want deeper analysis from AI than is currently available; they accept assistance on mundane parts of work, but expect the assistant to be better at offering substantive insights and to respect scope boundaries.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I want AI to point out where I could be wrong or identify potential problems ... not do everything for me ..."* (Participant 89)
- *"Act like an assistant to reaffirm correctness of algorithms and catch typos or simple bugs."* (Participant 160)
- *"I want AI to review my code and provide help/analysis with the mundane parts of my work."* (Participant 142)

---

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

Code: Context-Aware Bug Detection & Fix

Participants emphasized that useful debugging AI must understand the broader codebase, domain knowledge, and historical context. The researchers described this code as "AI bug-fixing help should account for codebase context, domain knowledge, and prior bug history for accurate diagnosis and fixes." Developers want suggestions that respect code style, dependencies, and performance trade-offs rather than isolated snippets. Requests ranged from "Bug fixing (or at least reasonable suggestions) in a complex code repository that I'm not familiar with" (Participant 202) to wanting AI to "notice design patterns and recommending applicable documentation, or parsing error messages and giving a quick interpretation of the issue" (Participant 397).

Motivations include faster onboarding, safer changes in unfamiliar repos, and reducing time spent searching for prior fixes ("Domain knowledge sourced from tribal knowledge and memory based information, picking potential bugs" — Participant 185). Conditions noted: AI should avoid “endless loops” of suggestions and must balance high- and low-level guidance ("Be able to fully understand the context, perform tasks concisely and efficiently, and avoid falling into an endless loop." — Participant 314). Participants also flagged that cross-context understanding is a hard requirement for AI to be trusted on complex code.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"AI needs understanding of context you are working in"* (Participant 107)
- *"Bug fixing ... in a complex code repository that I'm not familiar with."* (Participant 202)
- *"Search (e.g. for existing examples of solutions), coding suggestions (high and low level), debugging and problem solving."* (Participant 382)

#### Theme: Background Quality and Standards Check

Code: Proactive Bug Detection & Mitigation

Participants want AI to surface defects proactively—spotting bugs as they are written, providing real-time code review, and integrating with testing pipelines to prevent regressions. The manual description states: "AI should identify bugs while coding, through real-time review, code analysis, or integration with testing pipelines to prevent regressions before they occur." Respondents expressed interest in real-time feedback ("I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code! I want it to give me code review feedback in real time." — Participant 167) and in assistance with test automation and early defect detection to accelerate delivery while preserving quality ("I want AI to play a bigger role in accelerating code generation, test automation, and identifying bugs early." — Participant 241).

Desired outcomes include fewer regressions, higher code quality, and reduced manual review burden. Boundaries include expectations that AI should boost productivity “without compromising code quality or control” (Participant 241) and not eliminate human ideation or responsibility for system-level correctness.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I want AI to spot bugs while I'm writing the code! ... code review feedback in real time."* (Participant 167)
- *"I want AI to assist most in accelerating boilerplate code generation, suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early"* (Participant 172)
- *"Code should be bug free, only ideation should be mine. Rest all code level heavy lifting I would like to see by AI"* (Participant 287)

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

Code: Understanding/ Complexity Limitations

Developers worry that AI lacks the tacit, multi-step contextual understanding required for many debugging tasks. The researchers summarized this as "AI lacks the deep project/system knowledge, tacit understanding, and ability to navigate complex, multi-system bugs effectively." Respondents cited the need for implicit knowledge—UX expectations, helper functions, compliance libraries, and historical design decisions—that rarely appears in code alone: "When coding, multiple steps of decisions are made ... often informed by implicit knowledge from working on the system" (Participant 10). Participants described current tools as unable to gather context automatically without becoming a hindrance, especially for integration testing and multi-service interactions ("Systems design and integration testing ... cannot grasp enough context" — Participant 181).

The feared outcome is that AI-driven changes may be syntactically correct but conceptually wrong for the product. Participants placed boundaries around scope and complexity: AI can assist with well-scoped tasks with easily validated outcomes, but not with deep debugging across systems or architecture-level problem solving. Security concerns were also linked to context gaps, because an AI that doesn't fully understand the system could introduce vulnerabilities.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"The size of changes that AI bring in ... often informed by implicit knowledge from working on the system"* (Participant 10)
- *"Debugging would be challenging since it would require AI to step through my program and understand the program state..."* (Participant 27)
- *"Debugging and working on existing code bases. The current level of tooling we have is not good enough to pull context automatically..."* (Participant 186)

---

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

Code: Lack of Reliability & Trust / Avoid AI-caused Bugs

A central concern is that AI is currently unreliable: it hallucinates, overconfidently presents incorrect fixes, or produces code that’s hard to maintain. The code description—"AI often produces incorrect, incomplete, or overconfident fixes, which can cause harm or waste time"—appears repeatedly across respondents. Many said they use AI for learning or syntax help but not for root cause analysis or performance optimizations because they "do NOT trust it to root cause" (Participant 88). Examples of failures included incorrect assumptions (e.g., month lengths) and fixes that would introduce subtle bugs elsewhere ("it wrote code that assumed that every month has 30 days" — Participant 392).

Participants worry about time wasted chasing confident-but-wrong suggestions and the long-term maintenance burden of AI-generated code ("AI-generated code is often not very readable and maintainable" — Participant 149). The boundary is clear: AI can help with small, well-bounded tasks where output is easy to validate, but users expect humans to lead for complex or high-risk changes.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I do NOT trust it to root cause, or do perf optimizations."* (Participant 88)
- *"AI is very bad at understanding the context and throwing wrong answers with at most confidence, makes us waste time"* (Participant 215)
- *"It occasionally writes bad code. ... That's not much of a productivity gain."* (Participant 392)

---

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Participants insist on human-led final decisions for critical bug fixes and mitigations. The research description states: "Final decisions for critical bug fixes should remain human-led, especially in complex or high-impact scenarios." This is framed as an ethical and operational requirement: AI may propose mitigations, but the designated responsible engineer (DRI) or on-call person must approve and implement them. For example, one respondent noted they would not want AI to immediately mitigate incidents without human intervention: "While I am DRI/On-call I would not like AI to right away Mitigate the issue and would require Human intervention once the mitigation is ready by AI" (Participant 209).

Accountability concerns also relate to trade-offs, tacit knowledge, and the need for nuanced judgment in architectural or complex debugging decisions ("core architectural decisions ... need deep context of the project" — Participant 57). The desired arrangement is AI as a companion that informs but does not supplant the human decision-maker.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I prefer AI not handle core architectural decisions or debugging tricky issues ... AI can assist, but I want to stay in control"* (Participant 57)
- *"While I am DRI/On-call I would not like AI to right away Mitigate the issue ... would require Human intervention"* (Participant 209)
- *"AI can assist, but the final judgment should stay human-led."* (Participant 403)

#### Theme: Privacy, Security and Risk-Sensitive Areas

Code: Security-critical bug fixes

Respondents are explicit that AI should not independently handle security-critical or compliance-sensitive bugs. The code's description—"AI should not independently fix security-critical or compliance-sensitive bugs"—reflects fear of introducing subtle vulnerabilities or missing critical checks. Participants warned that security tasks have high stakes ("The stakes of missing something critical can lead to a potential breach" — Participant 37) and that AI lacks the necessary risk management and business understanding. Some suggested AI could be used in review or as a second pair of eyes but not as the agent of change for security-sensitive code ("Anything pertaining to security shouldn't be handled by AI (but perhaps reviewed by it)" — Participant 188).

Boundaries include requiring human oversight for any security-related changes and limiting AI to advisory roles where thorough human review remains mandatory.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Critical Bug Fixes / Security critical tasks - The stakes of missing something critical can lead to a potential breach"* (Participant 37)
- *"Anything pertaining to security shouldn't be handled by AI (but perhaps reviewed by it)"* (Participant 188)
- *"Security because it would still need a human to do a thorough review"* (Participant 408)

---

#### Theme: Professional Identity & Craftsmanship/Skill Preservation

Code: Enjoyment & Skill-building Preservation

Many developers value debugging as an opportunity to learn, grow, and enjoy craftsmanship. The manual description—"Developers value debugging for enjoyment, skill growth, and learning; they do not want AI to remove these opportunities"—captures a sentiment where AI should enhance, not replace, learning experiences. Some participants said they deliberately debug first to build understanding before consulting AI ("I prefer to do debugging on my own before asking AI so that I can build understanding the code" — Participant 333). Others noted that relying too much on AI could erode skill acquisition and long-term expertise ("AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks" — Participant 16).

The implication is that tooling should be designed to support learning and retain opportunities for manual practice—e.g., by presenting hints rather than full solutions, or by encouraging developers to try and then consult AI.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I enjoy debugging ... having an AI tool to help me would free up time for doing more of these!!"* (Participant 3)
- *"AI should enhance human engineer's learning and development, not replace tasks that allow those engineers to become better engineers."* (Participant 16)
- *"I prefer to do debugging on my own before asking AI so that I can build understanding the code"* (Participant 333)

---

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Across themes, developers want AI to reduce routine workload (Workflow Efficiency) and to act as a collaborative assistant (Comprehension & Collaboration Support) while simultaneously fearing unreliable, context-insensitive interventions (Quality & Trust Issues; Domain, Context Gaps). This creates a complementary but tension-filled picture: AI is welcome when it saves time and provides clear, verifiable value, but resisted when it claims understanding it does not have.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Common conditions are: well-scoped tasks, human-in-the-loop approval for mitigations, clear traceability of changes, domain/context awareness, and explicit exclusion from security-critical or architectural decisions. In short, AI support is acceptable when outcomes are easy to validate and risk is low.

- Task-specific nuances: Bug Fixing Debugging is unique because it requires both localized code fixes and system-level, often tacit, knowledge. Debugging mixes repeatable patterns (log parsing, reproducible unit failures) where AI can help, with emergent, cross-system failures that demand human judgment. The dual nature of debugging amplifies both the potential value and the perceived risk of AI assistance.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is not binary but contingent on observable accuracy, transparency of reasoning, and the ability of humans to retain control. Developers favor tools that explain suggestions, ask clarifying questions, and defer final actions to humans. Overconfidence or hallucination by AI erodes trust quickly, even if it occasionally produces helpful outputs.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives: A small number of respondents expressed openness to AI taking on more substantial roles (e.g., "I want AI to handle it all" with caveats), but then qualified this by noting current limitations (Participant 88). These participants represent exploratory adopters who may be early testers of higher-autonomy workflows.

- Unique insights: One participant framed AI as a "judge companion" that could act as an assistive decision-maker during on-call incidents, provided humans retain the final say (Participant 209). This suggests hybrid operational models where AI proposes and ranks mitigations but never executes without approval.

- Ambivalent responses: Several participants simultaneously said they enjoy debugging and would like AI to free them for more interesting problems (Participant 3). That ambivalence implies designers can increase adoption by positioning AI as an enabler of more challenging, rewarding work rather than as a replacement.

- Contradictions within individuals: Some respondents asked for proactive fixes and real-time mitigation while also stating they would not want AI to autonomously mitigate incidents—illustrating a desire for speed plus human accountability. Designers must therefore separate detection/diagnosis from automated remediation.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI that reduces rote work, collaborates transparently, and understands context—but only within clear boundaries that preserve safety, learning, and human accountability. Tools should prioritize explainability, scoped autonomy, and integration with codebase metadata (tests, history, dependency graphs). The design objective is to maximize time saved on low-cognitive tasks while minimizing the risk of incorrect or unsafe changes.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Rote Task Automation**
  - Capability: Automate log gathering, boilerplate fixes, cache invalidation, template generation, and straightforward refactors to save low-cognitive developer time.
  - Rationale: Participants want "repetitive grunge work" removed so they can focus on higher-value tasks. ("Having AI do a lot of repetitive grunge work" — Participant 319)

- **Context-Aware Suggestions (Context-Aware Bug Detection & Fix)**
  - Capability: Leverage repository history, dependency graphs, tests, and domain-specific documentation to produce contextually appropriate suggestions and highlight potential side effects.
  - Rationale: Developers stressed that AI needs to "understand the context you are working in" to be useful and safe. (Participants 107, 202)

- **Collaborative, Explainable Assistance (Comprehension & Collaboration Support)**
  - Capability: Provide explanations, ask clarifying questions, and present ranked suggestions rather than opaque edits; integrate with PR review and local development flows.
  - Rationale: Users prefer an assistant that "points out where I could be wrong" and "reaffirms correctness" without taking over. (Participants 89, 160)

- **Proactive Detection Integrated with CI (Proactive Bug Detection & Mitigation)**
  - Capability: Surface likely bugs and test gaps in real time and integrate with CI to block regressions or suggest focused tests.
  - Rationale: Participants asked for real-time, pipeline-integrated checks to catch bugs early. (Participants 167, 241)

- **Human-in-the-Loop Controls and Traceability**
  - Capability: Require explicit human approval for code changes, show diffs, provenance and confidence levels, and enable rollback; keep audit logs linking suggestions to sources.
  - Rationale: Strong desire for accountability: "I would require Human intervention once the mitigation is ready by AI" (Participant 209)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Do Not Autonomously Fix Security-critical Bugs (Security-critical bug fixes)**
  - Risk: Autonomous modification of security-sensitive code can introduce breaches or compliance violations.
  - Rationale: Participants insisted that "anything pertaining to security shouldn't be handled by AI" without human review. (Participant 188)

- **Do Not Make Unexplained, Overconfident Changes (Lack of Reliability & Trust / Avoid AI-caused Bugs)**
  - Risk: Hallucinated or unexplained fixes erode trust and waste time; avoid surfacing fixes as definitive without evidence.
  - Rationale: Many reported AI "throwing wrong answers with at most confidence" causing more work. (Participant 215)

- **Do Not Operate Without Context Verification (Understanding/ Complexity Limitations)**
  - Risk: Applying fixes without verifying domain or tacit knowledge can break integrations and UX expectations.
  - Rationale: AI must not assume understanding of implicit system knowledge; changes should be validated against tests and historical patterns. (Participant 10)

- **Do Not Remove Learning Opportunities (Enjoyment & Skill-building Preservation)**
  - Risk: Fully automated solutions can hinder skill development and reduce long-term team capability.
  - Rationale: Developers want AI to "enhance human engineer's learning ... not replace tasks" that build expertise. (Participant 16)

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to automate repetitive, low-cognitive debugging tasks (log parsing, templates, basic refactors) so they can focus on complex problem solving.
- They want AI as a collaborative assistant that explains reasoning and asks clarifying questions, not as a fully autonomous fixer.
- Critical design implications: prioritize context-awareness, explainability, CI/test integration, and human-in-the-loop controls.
- Guardrails required: prevent autonomous security fixes, avoid overconfident/unexplained changes, and ensure context verification before applying fixes.
- Tension: strong desire for efficiency gains coexists with distrust of current AI reliability and concern for skill erosion.
- Recommendation: build AI tools that save time on rote work, integrate with repo and test metadata for context, surface confidence and provenance, and defer final actions to human owners.
