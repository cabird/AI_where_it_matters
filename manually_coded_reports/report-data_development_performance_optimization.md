# Report of Qualitative Analysis for Performance Optimization (Category: Development)

This report is an AI-generated synthesis of manually coded survey responses from software developers about AI usage in Performance Optimization (Development). I preserved the research team's thematic structure, integrated provided code descriptions, and analyzed patterns and tensions across responses. The analysis draws on representative participant quotes to illustrate motivations, boundaries, and concerns developers have about AI in performance work.

## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency

Developers consistently want AI to speed up routine and time-consuming parts of performance work while preserving correctness and standards. The coded sub-theme "Code optimization and efficiency improvements" captures this desire: participants imagine AI assisting with intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, architectural decision support, and systematic refactoring to reduce unnecessary code. As one participant framed the hope succinctly, “Over the next 1-3 years, I’d like AI to play a bigger role in intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, and architectural decision support. These areas often consume significant time and require deep context. AI could help accelerate delivery while maintaining high quality and consistency.” (Participant 9). The motivation is pragmatic — free developer time, faster delivery cycles, and consistent adherence to repository standards.

At the same time, developers want these efficiency gains to translate into concrete performance outcomes: fewer lines of code, fewer errors, and improvements in accessibility, performance, and security. Requests range from simple "performance optimization" (Participant 110) to more explicit goals like "Code refactoring and performance improvements" (Participant 333) and ensuring code handles large datasets and dependency impacts ("I'd really like it if AI helps me make sure the code I'm writing meets repository standards, handles the size of data I'm processing efficiently, and helps me understand dependencies upstream and downstream." — Participant 39). Boundaries are implicit: AI is expected to propose and accelerate changes rather than unilaterally push risky edits without human validation.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Over the next 1-3 years, I’d like AI to play a bigger role in intelligent code reviews, automated test generation, and architectural decision support..."* (Participant 9)  
- *"Reducing lines of codes and enabling more cognitive reasoning capabilities"* (Participant 29)  
- *"I'd really like it if AI helps me make sure the code I'm writing meets repository standards, handles the size of data I'm processing efficiently..."* (Participant 39)  
- *"Code refactoring and performance improvements"* (Participant 333)

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

Developers also want AI that understands and adapts to the specific context of their projects. The code "Context-aware performance recommendations" describes expectations for AI to suggest optimizations tailored to the codebase, dependencies, usage patterns, and non-functional requirements. Participants want suggestions that fit the scenario (e.g., applicable design patterns, reusability improvements, and non-functional requirement guidance) rather than one-size-fits-all heuristics. One participant highlighted this by asking for assistance in "accelerating boilerplate code generation, suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early in the development cycle." (Participant 172).

The desired outcome is actionable, relevant guidance that respects architectural constraints and execution environments: "Optimization. I want AI to identify how to execute the tasks I am working on faster and more secure." (Participant 349). Several participants also explicitly asked for real-time suggestions during development and integration with tools that understand upstream and downstream dependencies, implying that effectiveness depends on the model's access to project-specific context and telemetry. Developers expect the system to be sensitive to their codebase’s patterns and to surface optimizations that can be realistically adopted.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I want AI to assist most in accelerating boilerplate code generation, suggesting context-aware optimizations, and identifying potential bugs early in the development cycle."* (Participant 172)  
- *"1. Design pattern implementation based on scenario 2. Reusability 3. Suggestions on non-functional requirements"* (Participant 272)  
- *"Optimization. I want AI to identify how to execute the tasks I am working on faster and more secure."* (Participant 349)  
- *"Over the next 1–3 years, I’d like AI to play a bigger role in automated code reviews, intelligent test generation, and real-time performance optimization suggestions."* (Participant 403)

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

Developers voiced clear limits on delegating performance work to AI when deep system context and architectural judgment are required. The code "Lack of Deep Context and System Understanding" encapsulates this concern: participants believe many performance decisions demand nuanced knowledge of system architecture, trade-offs, runtime constraints, and interactions across services that current models do not reliably possess. One participant warned, "I might not want AI to directly perform performance optimization, as it sometimes doesn't have the necessary context and ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon." (Participant 269). Another emphasized preferring human-led decisions for trade-off management: "I wouldn’t want AI to handle performance optimization. It often needs deep context about the system, trade-offs, and real-time constraints that are hard to generalize." (Participant 301).

Architectural-level optimizations, in particular, are seen as risky for AI to make autonomously: "the typical performance optimization needs to occur at the architecture level, how the process/services interact with each other. In my opinion, current Gen AI models like GPT lack the vision of the 'big picture' needed for architectural optimization." (Participant 345). The boundary is clear—developers are comfortable with AI assisting within function- or module-level scope, but not with AI making system-wide architectural changes or decisions that require cross-service visibility and strategic judgment.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I might not want AI to directly perform performance optimization, as it sometimes doesn't have the necessary context and ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon."* (Participant 269)  
- *"I wouldn’t want AI to handle performance optimization. It often needs deep context about the system, trade-offs, and real-time constraints..."* (Participant 301)  
- *"Performance optimization... the typical performance optimization needs to occur at the architecture level... current Gen AI models like GPT lack the vision of the 'big picture'..."* (Participant 345)

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

A distinct set of concerns centers on the risk that AI-suggested optimizations could introduce bugs, regressions, or hard-to-debug performance issues. The code "Risk of Introducing Bugs or Regressions" summarizes developers’ wariness: performance changes can have subtle ripple effects that require careful testing and human inspection. One participant cautioned, "performance optimization: these changes need to be thoroughly investigated and tested; a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems." (Participant 164). Another put it bluntly: "Bug fixes and performance optimisation, since I dont want a fix to break something else. And it is sometimes difficult to catch subtle details when we're not the ones writing/guiding the code." (Participant 318).

This theme signals a need for defensive design: AI outputs must be explainable, accompanied by test artifacts or benchmarks, and easily reversible. Developers want assistance but not at the expense of system reliability, and they expect rigorous validation pipelines around any AI-suggested performance change.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"performance optimization: these changes need to be thoroughly investigated and tested; a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems"* (Participant 164)  
- *"Bug fixes and performance optimisation, since I dont want a fix to break something else..."* (Participant 318)

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Across responses, there is a strong expectation that engineers retain final authority over performance decisions. The description provided by researchers notes developers want to ensure responsibility and alignment with system goals. Participants framed AI as an assistant for suggestions rather than an executor: "Coding/Programming and Performance Optimization, I would like AI to assist and help in suggestions but what actually goes into should be decided by the Engineer who knows the system in and out and can hold responsibility if anything goes down." (Participant 299). The iterative nature of optimization — multiple feedback loops, operational metrics, and trade-off discussions — reinforces the need for human-in-the-loop control and clear assignment of accountability.

This theme intersects with trust and domain-knowledge concerns: because performance decisions can impact uptime, latency, and cost, teams insist on retaining review gates, human sign-off, and ownership of changes suggested by AI.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Coding/Programming and Performance Optimization... I would like AI to assist and help in suggestions but what actually goes into should be decided by the Engineer who knows the system in and out..."* (Participant 299)

#### Theme: Professional Identity & Craftsmanship/Skill Preservation

Some developers view performance optimization as a core craftsmanship area that contributes to job satisfaction and professional growth. The researchers described this as preserving high-skill, rewarding work. One participant articulated this sentiment succinctly: "I dont want AI to handle performance optimization or AI development, as they bring satisfaction to my work, and needs craftsmanship." (Participant 285). For these respondents, fully automating performance tasks risks deskilling engineers and removing the intellectually rewarding aspects of their role. They prefer AI that augments rather than replaces the craft of optimization.

This boundary is partly cultural: teams wish to maintain opportunities for engineers to exercise skill and ownership over nuanced performance decisions, even as they accept AI for repetitive or mechanically intensive tasks.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I dont want AI to handle performance optimization or AI development, as they bring satisfaction to my work, and needs craftsmanship."* (Participant 285)

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Respondents consistently balance a desire for AI to improve "Workflow Efficiency" and provide "Context-aware performance recommendations" with strong reservations about AI making high-stakes, system-level changes. In practice developers want AI to handle repetitive, well-bounded tasks (e.g., code-level refactoring, test generation) and to offer context-aware suggestions, but they resist delegating architectural decisions or any change that could create regressions.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is highly conditional. Developers favor tools that (a) are transparent about their suggestions, (b) include tests, benchmarks or explainability, (c) limit scope to the level where AI can be validated (functions/modules), and (d) keep humans in the decision loop for architectural or cross-service optimizations. Multiple quotes stress that AI should "assist and help in suggestions" while engineers remain the final deciders (Participant 299).

- Task-specific nuances: Performance Optimization differs from other development tasks because changes can have non-local, emergent effects on latency, throughput, and stability. This increases perceived risk and raises the bar for AI reliability. While code formatting or boilerplate generation is low-risk, optimization often requires system-level telemetry and knowledge of trade-offs (cost vs. latency, caching vs. freshness), which respondents believe AI currently lacks.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is conditional and layered. Developers will accept AI that augments their workflow, reduces toil, and provides context-aware recommendations — but only when tools make their reasoning explicit, provide reproducible tests/benchmarks, and leave accountability and final approval to humans. There is also a professional-cultural dimension: some resist full automation to protect craftsmanship and ownership.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives that contradict dominant themes: A few terse responses (e.g., single-word requests like "performance optimization" — Participant 110, 114) suggest some developers may be comfortable with broader AI intervention, perhaps in environments with robust CI/CD and automated testing. These participants may represent contexts where rapid, automated optimizations are acceptable.

- Unique insights that don't fit neatly: One participant acknowledged that AI could do a "good job optimizing functions and method" while still arguing that architecture-level optimization needs human vision (Participant 345). This split view highlights a nuanced middle ground: function-level suggestions are acceptable, but cross-system strategies are not.

- Ambivalent responses: Several developers simultaneously request AI help with code-level and real-time suggestions while warning against AI taking ownership of decisions—indicating conditional enthusiasm rather than binary acceptance.

- Contradictions within individuals: Some participants ask for "architectural decision support" (Participant 9) but elsewhere express distrust of AI's "big picture" vision (Participant 345). This indicates that confidence in AI's architectural assistance depends on maturity of the tool, the granularity of recommendations, and available contextual data.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Developers want AI that augments their performance optimization workflow — speeding routine work, offering context-aware suggestions, and generating testable artifacts — while ensuring humans maintain final control over high-risk, architectural decisions. Tools must be scoped, explainable, and integrated with telemetry and testing pipelines to earn trust.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Context-aware recommendation engine**
  - Capability: Integrate project metadata, dependency graphs, and runtime telemetry to produce tailored optimization suggestions (e.g., caching strategies, algorithmic changes) rather than generic tips.
  - Rationale: Participants requested "context-aware optimizations" and scenario-based design suggestions (Participant 172, 272).
  - Example: "I want AI to assist... suggesting context-aware optimizations..." (Participant 172)

- **Automated code review and test-generation scaffold**
  - Capability: Produce suggested code changes alongside generated unit/integration tests and benchmark artifacts to validate performance impacts.
  - Rationale: Developers asked for "automated test generation" and emphasized the need to test changes thoroughly (Participant 9, 164).
  - Example: "automated test generation" (Participant 9); "these changes need to be thoroughly investigated and tested..." (Participant 164)

- **Refactoring and standards compliance assistant**
  - Capability: Suggest refactorings that reduce code bloat, enforce repository standards, and highlight upstream/downstream impacts.
  - Rationale: Multiple participants requested reduction of lines of code, refactoring, and repository-standard enforcement (Participant 29, 333, 39).
  - Example: "Reducing lines of codes..." (Participant 29); "Code refactoring and performance improvements" (Participant 333)

- **Explainability and change rationale**
  - Capability: For each optimization, provide an explicit rationale, expected trade-offs, and estimated performance impact (with confidence levels).
  - Rationale: To address trust and debugging concerns, developers need to understand why a change was recommended and what it affects (Participant 269, 318).
  - Example: "doesn't have the necessary context and ends up making changes that are hard to understand..." (Participant 269)

- **Human-in-the-loop control and approval workflows**
  - Capability: Provide gates for human review and sign-off, allow easy rollback, and surface ownership/attribution for suggested changes.
  - Rationale: Developers want final decision authority and accountability for performance changes (Participant 299).
  - Example: "what actually goes into should be decided by the Engineer..." (Participant 299)

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous architectural changes without human approval**
  - Risk: Unsupervised system-wide modifications can produce emergent regressions and violate strategic trade-offs.
  - Rationale: Respondents argued that AI lacks the “big picture” needed for architectural optimization (Participant 345).
  - Example: "current Gen AI models like GPT lack the vision of the 'big picture'..." (Participant 345)

- **Opaque, unexplained edits**
  - Risk: Black-box suggestions that are hard to interpret increase debugging cost and reduce trust.
  - Rationale: Participants highlighted changes that are "hard to understand and build upon" as dangerous (Participant 269).
  - Example: "ends up making changes that are hard to understand and build upon." (Participant 269)

- **Replacing human ownership or craftsmanship**
  - Risk: Removing opportunities for engineers to exercise skill and make decisions can harm morale and team capability.
  - Rationale: Some developers value performance work as craftsmanship and resist full automation (Participant 285).
  - Example: "they bring satisfaction to my work, and needs craftsmanship." (Participant 285)

- **Suggesting unvalidated performance tweaks**
  - Risk: Recommendations without tests, benchmarks, or rollback strategies may introduce subtle regressions.
  - Rationale: Multiple participants warned that poor performance settings could create hard-to-debug problems (Participant 164, 318).
  - Example: "a bad performance setting might bring a lot of hard to debug problems" (Participant 164)

## Executive Summary

- Developers want AI to speed up and standardize code-level performance tasks (code optimization, refactoring, test generation) while preserving correctness and standards.
- Developers do not want AI making autonomous architectural or system-level performance changes without deep context, explainability, and human approval.
- Design implication: prioritize context-aware recommendations, integrated test generation, and explainable rationales tied to telemetry and dependency information.
- Design implication: enforce human-in-the-loop approval, provide reversible changes, and surface confidence and trade-offs for every suggestion.
- Tension: conditional acceptance — developers welcome automation for bounded tasks but require safeguards for anything that affects system reliability or professional craftsmanship.
- Recommendation: build AI tools that augment developer skill (assistive suggestions + test artifacts + clear ownership) rather than replace human judgement in architecture and final decision-making.
