# Qualitative Analysis for Refactoring & Maintenance/Updates
# Category: Development

This report is an AI-generated synthesis of manually coded survey responses from software developers about AI usage in Refactoring & Maintenance/Updates (Development). The analysis preserves the human-coded themes and codes, integrates representative participant quotes, and draws analytic insights about patterns, tensions, and implications for AI tool design. The synthesis approach prioritized faithful representation of researchers' descriptions and clustered participant sentiments to highlight motivations, boundaries, and design-relevant behaviors.

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for repetitive, well-scoped refactoring and maintenance (package updates, boilerplate, style changes) to free time for higher-value work.
- They want AI to reason across files and modules—propagating changes and understanding dependencies—while enforcing coding standards and generating tests where possible.
- Strong resistance exists to autonomous, large-scale structural changes: engineers insist on human oversight, explicit approvals, and accountability.
- Trust depends on verifiability: CI/test integration, transparent rationales, previews, and risk assessments are critical design requirements.
- The key tension is between productivity gains from automation and risk control; designers should favor conservative, reviewable automation with configurable policies and explicit human-in-the-loop gates.
- Recommendation: build AI refactoring tools that are test-aware, codebase-aware, standards-integrated, and that default to conservative, explainable suggestions requiring human approval for structural changes.

## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: Workflow Efficiency / Rote Task Automation

Participants consistently framed refactoring and maintenance as ripe for automation because much of this work is repetitive, well-defined, and low-value relative to design or feature work. The researcher-coded description—"AI takes over boring, repetitive, well-defined refactor and maintenance tasks so developers can focus on higher-value work. AI automates package updates, security patches, and regular maintenance tasks. AI performs upgrades of libraries, packages, and dependencies with minimal disruption."—captures the dominant motivation: free engineers from "grunge" work. Developers want AI to handle package and dependency updates, style-wide changes, boilerplate generation, and routine test generation, especially where strong CI makes verification straightforward. As one participant put it, refactoring is "often the most boring task" and automating it "would be amazing" (Participant 1). Another emphasized multi-file scope and the repetitive nature: "Refactoring would be the biggest help! It's almost always tedious and well-defined tasks. Frequently it needs more than just find-replace though... almost always it is over large file and multi-file workflows." (Participant 26).

Desired outcomes include time savings, fewer human-hours on monotony, and more time for problem-solving and feature design. Participants also set boundaries tied to verifiability: where CI or reliable tests exist, automation is acceptable because regressions are easier to catch ("tedious but easy to test (assuming strong CI...)" — Participant 62). Several responses highlight that AI should be used to "mimic test code based on good examples" and manage style changes across large codebases (Participant 262), reinforcing that automated refactors must be testable and trackable.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Refactoring for sure. It's often the most boring task for me, and being able to mostly automate it would be amazing. Current progress is already great for a lot of use cases."* (Participant 1)
- *"Refactoring would be the biggest help! It's almost always tedious and well-defined tasks... it is over large file and multi-file workflows."* (Participant 26)
- *"Refactoring: tedious but easy to test (assuming strong CI a.k.a. Continuous integration testing)."* (Participant 62)
- *"AI can take on some of the time-intensive but repetitive refactoring work or routine boilerplate code generation."* (Participant 203)

#### Theme: Multi-/Cross- Context Support

The manual code "Coordinated multi-file/multi-module changes" captures a distinct desire: AI should understand relationships across files and modules to make consistent, architecture-aware changes. Participants want tools that propagate a single change (e.g., datatype, nullability) across the codebase and help with re-architecting or class-level decisions that span boundaries. The motivation is clear: many refactors are not isolated; they require awareness of dependencies, usage sites, and higher-level design constraints. One developer asked for "more cross-codebase awareness, so I can make a single change... and AI will help implement those changes across the rest of the codebase" (Participant 2).

Context and boundaries: this capability is most valuable in large, interconnected repositories where manual tracking of all affected places is error-prone. Participants expect AI to "know which files are related" and "find the files that are used in context to the currently open files" (Participant 332). They also expect architectural reasoning—drawing conclusions at the class or module level—so that AI-suggested multi-step changes don't break invariants or create inconsistent abstractions (Participant 47).

**Representative quotes**:
- *"More cross-codebase awareness, so I can make a single change... and AI will help implement those changes across the rest of the codebase."* (Participant 2)
- *"Improvements in understanding large code bases and drawing architectural conclusions will be necessary... Multi-step changes across boundaries for large code bases is necessary in our environment."* (Participant 47)
- *"AI should know which files are related to the code. AI should also know what the code that is spread across these files is doing."* (Participant 332)

#### Theme: Quality, Performance, and Security Enhancements

Under the code "Enforcing coding standards and best practices," participants want AI to do more than mechanical edits—they expect it to identify poor coding practices, suggest improvements, and help enforce organizational or platform standards. The researcher description—"AI detects poor coding practices and suggests improvements to align with standards"—reflects calls for AI to function as an automated reviewer that highlights maintainability, security, and performance gaps during refactors.

Developers envision AI that supplements reviews and testing: automating unit test suggestion and refactoring while reminding teams of coding standards (Participant 164). Some even expect platform-specific awareness, for example that the tool checks "overall azure, msft and coding standards" in code and docs (Participant 354). This theme is motivated by the desire to raise baseline code quality and to make refactors not only syntactically correct but also aligned with best practices and compliance requirements. The desired outcome is consistent, secure, and maintainable code with less manual enforcement overhead.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Help identify bad coding practices."* (Participant 21)
- *"automation of refactoring and unit tests; coding best practices suggestions during reviews"* (Participant 164)
- *"it also is aware of the overall azure, msft and coding standards so it should check that in coding and docs"* (Participant 354)

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Need for Accountability, Human Oversight, & Decision Control

Researchers summarized this theme as skepticism about full automation and a preference to retain human responsibility for structural changes. Participants resist giving AI unchecked autonomy to perform substantial refactors, create new files, or alter project structure without explicit review. The description notes that "Humans are skeptical about complete refactor automation. They prefer to keep the final responsibility because of the fear that AI will overreach..." This skepticism often stems from experience: one developer recounted asking for a small addition only to see AI create "new classes and new files" and fundamentally change the code structure (Participant 39).

Context: responsibility and accountability are central, especially in production systems where engineers must sign off on changes. Boundaries include an explicit human-in-the-loop for large or structural modifications. Participants accept AI as a feedback provider—akin to a human reviewer—but not as an autonomous refactorer: "I do not want AI to 'handle' any of it, given that I am accountable for it. But I welcome AI systems that provide feedback on my design and implementation" (Participant 167). Another succinct boundary: "I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first" (Participant 39).

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first... next thing I know there are new classes and new files"* (Participant 39)
- *"AI should not perform any large-scale refactoring or optimizations."* (Participant 182)
- *"I do not want AI to 'handle' any of it, given that I am accountable for it. But I welcome AI systems that provide feedback..."* (Participant 167)

#### Theme: Quality & Trust Issues

The code "Low trust in performance/correctness" encapsulates concerns that AI-refactors may be incorrect, introduce subtle bugs, or require more human time to review and fix than doing the refactor manually. Participants described past experiences where AI-led refactors were "really bad" or "more time consuming" than doing it themselves (Participants 159, 35). This distrust is particularly acute when AI modifies large swaths of code at once; the perceived review burden rises and confidence declines: "I can't trust the AI to be correct, and when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing or even fixing the AI's changes" (Participant 325).

Contextual factors shaping trust include the difficulty of validating correctness—if precision is critical or correctness is hard to verify, participants prefer human handling (Participant 385). The implication is clear: without strong correctness guarantees, rollback mechanisms, or traceable rationales, developers will refrain from delegating refactors to AI.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I can't trust the AI to be correct, and when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing or even fixing the AI's changes"* (Participant 325)
- *"I do not want AI handling tasks where precision is important or where correctness is more difficult to validate than just doing it myself..."* (Participant 385)
- *"Refactoring - AI tends to be really bad at this and I'm very opinionated."* (Participant 159)

#### Theme: Domain, Context, or Knowledge Gaps

This theme highlights worries that AI lacks holistic understanding of architecture, cross-file dependencies, and "tribal" or domain-specific knowledge. The description—"Concern that AI lacks holistic understanding of architecture, cross-file dependencies, and nuanced decisions"—aligns with participants stating they prefer to manage changes requiring deep contextual knowledge or specialized domain expertise. For example, one developer avoids AI when they "can't provide sufficient context" or when changes require "tribal knowledge not found within the repository" (Participant 204).

Participants also express that complex, system-wide refactors are likely to be mishandled by AI: "Refactoring a system wide feature, AI won't do it correctly" (Participant 361). The boundary here is clear: AI is acceptable for boilerplate or well-instrumented tasks but not for nuanced architectural decisions or domain-heavy refactors where implicit knowledge and multi-step reasoning are required.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I prefer not to use AI for tasks where I can't provide sufficient context... if the code change requires specialized domain knowledge or tribal knowledge not found within the repository, I'd rather handle it myself."* (Participant 204)
- *"Complex refactoring's and anything not boilerplate."* (Participant 259)
- *"Refactoring a system wide feature, AI won't do it correctly."* (Participant 361)

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: Developers want AI to automate repetitive, well-scoped maintenance and enforce standards, but they simultaneously fear overreach, incorrect broad changes, and loss of control. The "want" for efficiency and consistency (automation, cross-file awareness, standards enforcement) directly contrasts with "don't want" anxieties about autonomy, correctness, and missing context—creating a tension between productivity gains and risk management.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Common conditions include: strong CI and test coverage (enables safe automation), explicit human approval for structural or large-scale changes, and local availability of context or documentation. Participants repeatedly tied willingness to delegate to AI to verifiability and human-in-the-loop safeguards.

- Task-specific nuances: Refactoring Maintenance Updates are frequently multi-file, involve implicit architecture knowledge, and may touch platform-specific or organizational standards. These attributes make refactoring different from single-file edits or feature coding: it requires global program analysis, dependency awareness, and sometimes domain expertise—features developers explicitly want AI to handle but also doubt it can.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is calibrated by predictability and verifiability. Developers are more willing to delegate tasks that are "tedious but easy to test." Conversely, trust collapses when AI produces large, opaque changes without traceable rationale. Hence, design must prioritize transparency, safe defaults, and fine-grained approval controls to reconcile autonomy with accountability.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority enthusiasm for broader autonomy: A small subset implied more optimistic views that AI could take on "much of the tedious refactoring" and even "create toy programs very easily" (Participant 193). These voices suggest some developers already see AI as sufficiently capable for a broad scope of refactors.

- Platform-specific expectations: One participant expects the AI to be aware of specific organizational standards ("azure, msft and coding standards")—an edge case where integrations with corporate policy and platform-specific lints are prioritized (Participant 354).

- Ambivalent respondents: Several participants expressed mixed views within a single response—welcoming AI for test and boilerplate generation while explicitly rejecting autonomous structural changes (Participant 167). This ambivalence highlights the need for nuanced, mode-based AI behavior (assistive vs. autonomous).

- Contradictory experiences: Some reported that AI-driven refactors were slower or more error-prone than manual work (Participant 35), yet others pointed to current progress being "already great for a lot of use cases" (Participant 1). These contradictions likely reflect varying tool maturity, differing codebase complexity, or inconsistency in how tools are configured and supervised.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Overall, the thematic synthesis indicates that AI tools for Refactoring Maintenance Updates should maximize automation on well-scoped, testable tasks while preserving human oversight and contextual awareness for large or complex changes. Tools must balance productivity with explicit safeguards, offer global codebase understanding, and provide transparency and traceability for suggested changes.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Rote Task Automation**
  - Capability: Automate repetitive refactors, dependency and package updates, and boilerplate generation with conservative, test-driven workflows.
  - Rationale: Developers want to offload "boring" maintenance and free time for higher-value work ("Refactoring for sure... would be amazing." — Participant 1).
  - Example: Provide one-click apply/preview for bulk style changes plus automated test generation to validate refactors (Participants 203, 62).

- **Coordinated Multi-file / Cross-module Awareness**
  - Capability: Analyze codebase-wide dependencies and propagate type or API changes across files while surfacing affected areas and rationale.
  - Rationale: Refactors often require consistent multi-file changes; developers expect AI to "help implement those changes across the rest of the codebase" (Participant 2).
  - Example: Show a dependency graph and list of modified files before applying multi-step refactors (Participants 47, 332).

- **Standards Enforcement and Best-practice Suggestions**
  - Capability: Detect poor coding practices and suggest or apply corrections aligned to org or platform standards, with configurable policy profiles.
  - Rationale: Developers want improved baseline quality and compliance (Participants 21, 164, 354).
  - Example: Integrate corporate style guides (e.g., Azure/MSFT) into checks and offer guided fixes.

- **Test-aware / CI-integrated Workflows**
  - Capability: Run or simulate existing test suites against proposed refactors and present test outcomes and possible regressions before changes are merged.
  - Rationale: Many participants accept automation when changes are "easy to test" and CI is strong (Participant 62).
  - Example: Automatic pre-merge test runs and risk scoring of the proposed refactor.

- **Transparent Change Rationale & Review Controls**
  - Capability: Provide human-readable explanations for each change, a diff preview, risk assessment, and mandatory human approval for structural changes.
  - Rationale: Developers require accountability and want to avoid opaque modifications ("I don't want AI to make substantial refactoring changes without interaction/consultation first." — Participant 39).
  - Example: "Explain why" panels and gating that require explicit consent for new files, new classes, or architecture-level modifications.

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Unsupervised Structural Rewrites**
  - Risk: AI autonomously creating/removing files or reorganizing project structure without human review can introduce regressions and unwanted complexity.
  - Rationale: Participants reported unwanted overreach where small requests led to new classes/files (Participant 39); many oppose "large-scale refactoring or optimizations" without interaction (Participant 182).

- **Opaque Bulk Changes Without Rationale**
  - Risk: Mass edits applied without clear explanations reduce trust and increase review overhead.
  - Rationale: "I can't trust the AI to be correct... when it changes too much code at once, I need to spend more time reviewing..." (Participant 325).

- **Replacing Domain Knowledge or Tribal Expertise**
  - Risk: Allowing AI to act where domain-specific, contextual, or tribal knowledge is required risks incorrect decisions.
  - Rationale: Participants prefer to handle tasks requiring "specialized domain knowledge or tribal knowledge" themselves (Participant 204).

- **Undisciplined Autonomy on Precision-Critical Tasks**
  - Risk: Delegating precision-sensitive refactors to AI without conservative checks can introduce subtle bugs.
  - Rationale: Developers explicitly avoid AI for tasks "where precision is important" (Participant 385).

- **Default Enabling of Large-scale Refactors**
  - Risk: Tools that default to enabling or suggesting major refactors without opt-in increase the chance of unwanted scope creep.
  - Rationale: Users want "interaction/consultation first" for substantial changes (Participant 39).
