## 1) Core Themes

### A. Where AI is Wanted

#### Theme: AI-assisted onboarding support/walkthroughs

Participants who want AI in mentoring and onboarding consistently frame it as a practical, task-focused aide that can create structure and reduce manual labor. The researcher-coded description—"Participants want AI to create onboarding/training plans, provide walkthroughs for new joiners, and answer newcomer questions"—aligns with many respondents who see AI as a generator of learning plans, documentation, and searchable resources. For example, Participant 269 notes that AI "has the ability to create learning plans which are very helpful," and Participant 272 explicitly requests "Auto-generated training plan for new onboardings." These comments emphasize the desire for AI to automate repetitive setup and learning-sequence construction so that new joiners can ramp faster.

At the same time participants imagine AI playing an active guiding role beyond static documents: providing walkthroughs, answering newcomer questions, and surfacing relevant resources. Participant 318 goes further, saying "Mentoring and onboarding automated by AI would be great. Rather than being just an assistant, it should also take the lead role sometimes," indicating a subset of respondents comfortable with greater AI initiative. Many also link improved documentation with onboarding outcomes—Participant 271 asks for AI to "handle draining but important tasks like writing effective documentation" and to "help in troubleshooting documentation, thus helping in onboarding as well." Boundaries emerge: most wishes emphasize AI as a facilitator of learning paths, searchable knowledge, and boilerplate generation rather than a full human replacement for all mentoring functions.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I would like AI to help in onboarding and in learning new technologies. It has the ability to create learning plans which are very helpful."* (Participant 269)
- *"Auto-generated training plan for new onboardings."* (Participant 272)
- *"I would love AI to handle draining but important tasks like writing effective documentation…"* (Participant 271)
- *"Onboarding and teaching new joiners."* (Participant 408)
- *"Helping me brain dump the knowledge I've gained over the years to help customers and onboard new people."* (Participant 401)

### B. Where AI is Not Wanted

#### Theme: Human-centric and relational nature of mentoring

The core concern here is that mentoring and onboarding are fundamentally human activities rooted in relationship-building, culture transmission, and integration into teams. The provided description—"Mentoring is fundamentally about human-to-human interaction, relationship building, and integration into teams"—is echoed across many responses. Participant 27 states plainly, "Mentoring is a human activity and would not be helpful for AI to do...this is a human-to-human activity to get the person engaged and integrated with other humans." Multiple participants emphasize that onboarding is not just procedural but social: Participant 122 stresses that new team members "need to interact with their team members to build relationships," and Participant 333 notes that personal mentoring "helps me build a connection with new joinee or team."

Participants draw a clear boundary: AI may help with rote tasks, but the relational core of mentoring—building trust, modeling behaviors, and socializing newcomers into team norms—must remain human-led. Several respondents explicitly reject handing off mentoring to technology (Participant 98: "Mentoring and onboarding shouldn't be done by an AI"), underscoring cultural and interpersonal limits to automation.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Mentoring is a human activity and would not be helpful for AI to do...this is a human-to-human activity to get the person engaged and integrated with other humans."* (Participant 27)
- *"Mentoring and onboarding to a team should involve humans."* (Participant 50)
- *"Onboarding, because new team members need to interact with their team members to build relationships. That's an essential part of being human..."* (Participant 122)

#### Theme: Need for oversight (AI as assistant, not replacement)

Participants consistently assert that if AI is used, it should be subordinate to human oversight—helpful for rote steps but not the primary mentor. The coded description notes this boundary: "AI might assist with rote onboarding steps, documentation, or simple tasks, but human oversight and connection are essential." Concerns about hallucination and accuracy drive these views. Participant 17 warns that "AI should definitely not be the primary factor in documentation, communication, or mentoring/onboarding. Its tendency to hallucinate is too great to risk... without significant human oversight." Others accept AI for entitlements setup or builds (Participant 70), but emphasize "there needs to be a human connection." This reflects a conditional acceptance: AI can streamline administrative chores but human mentors must validate, contextualize, and take responsibility for people-facing outcomes.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"AI should definitely not be the primary factor in documentation, communication, or mentoring/onboarding. Its tendency to hallucinate is too great..."* (Participant 17)
- *"Using AI for helping new people with the rote steps of onboarding...is fine, but there needs to be a human connection."* (Participant 70)
- *"Mentoring and onboarding is personal, but could be assisted by AI in someways, but I wouldn't want it to do the mentoring directly."* (Participant 83)

#### Theme: Limitations in handling nuances (empathy, subjectivity, culture)

Respondents emphasize that mentoring requires empathy, judgment, and cultural sensitivity—areas where AI currently falls short. The description states: "Participants highlight AI’s inability to capture cultural nuances, empathy, or subjective, opinion-based aspects of mentoring." Participant 10 underscores culture: "I don't want AI to handle mentoring. This is a very cultural task that requires human-human communication." The opinion-based nature of mentorship surfaces in Participant 71: "Mentoring, as it's often opinion-based and varies by mentor/mentee." Participant 228 links mentoring to growth for both parties ("mentoring requires empathy...mentoring teaches the mentor as well"), suggesting that the pedagogical and developmental dimensions are not just transactional knowledge transfers but relational learning that AI cannot replicate.

These responses generally reject AI for emotionally or culturally sensitive interactions, and they suggest that even when AI provides factual help, it must not supplant human judgment on subjective matters.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I don't want AI to handle mentoring. This is a very cultural task that requires human-human communication."* (Participant 10)
- *"Mentoring, as it's often opinion-based and varies by mentor/mentee."* (Participant 71)
- *"Mentoring requires empathy...I think these are activities that humans need to do to grow themselves as well."* (Participant 228)

#### Theme: High risk of errors and negative outcomes

Several participants worry about the severe consequences of AI mistakes in mentoring and onboarding—errors that could mislead new hires, create security or compliance problems, or damage careers. The code description captures this: "Mistakes in mentoring or onboarding could cause serious harm. Participants fear AI hallucinations or misguidance could negatively impact mentees." Participant 357 is explicit: "I don't want it to do mentoring because the cost of it getting it wrong is terrible and it will get it wrong." Participant 385 echoes distrust in factual accuracy: "Filling out details of documentation (I don't trust a stochastic parrot to be capable of getting it right...); mentoring and onboarding (building the personal connection is the point!!)." The risk calculus here is high: while AI may speed up tasks, the cost of an incorrect instruction or missing nuance is framed as potentially catastrophic for a new team member's learning and integration.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"I don't want it to do mentoring because the cost of it getting it wrong is terrible and it will get it wrong."* (Participant 357)
- *"Filling out details of documentation (I don't trust a stochastic parrot to be capable of getting it right...); mentoring and onboarding (building the personal connection is the point!!)"* (Participant 385)
- *"Taking care of customers requires empathy...mentoring requires empathy."* (Participant 228)

#### Theme: Mentor’s growth and development

A recurring but distinct concern is that mentoring benefits mentors as much as mentees; removing that activity risks stunting mentor development. The code description states: "Mentoring benefits the mentor as much as the mentee. Offloading it to AI undermines human learning, empathy, and leadership development." Participant 228 synthesizes this view: "mentoring requires empathy. I think these are activities that humans need to do to grow themselves as well (e.g. mentoring someone teaches the mentor as well)." Participants worry that if AI takes over mentoring, opportunities for mentors to learn coaching skills, reflect on their own knowledge, and develop leadership capabilities will diminish. This is framed as a systemic loss that could harm organizational capability over time, beyond the immediate onboarding task.

**Representative quotes**:
- *"Mentoring requires empathy. I think these are activities that humans need to do to grow themselves as well (e.g. mentoring someone teaches the mentor as well)."* (Participant 228)
- *"Mentoring and onboarding shouldn't be done by an AI. It's a human thing that shouldn't be handed off to technology."* (Participant 98)
- *"Mentoring and onboarding, as I like to do it and it helps me build a connection with new joinee or team if I am new joinee."* (Participant 333)

## 2) Cross-Cutting Patterns

- Complementary desires and concerns: There is a clear complementarity between the "Want AI" and "Don't want AI" themes. Developers want AI to handle structured, repetitive, and documentation-heavy aspects of onboarding (learning plans, boilerplate docs, searchable resources), while they resist AI in the relational, subjective, and developmental components of mentoring. The tension is pragmatic: maximize efficiency for low-risk tasks, preserve human agency for high-stakes and social tasks.

- Conditional acceptance: Acceptance of AI is strongly conditional. Participants repeatedly allow AI for "rote steps" (entitlements, builds), "brain dump" tasks, and generating training plans, but only under human oversight and review. The condition of oversight is justified by concerns about hallucinations, cultural insensitivity, and the mentor's role in socialization.

- Task-specific nuances: Mentoring Onboarding is unique compared to technical tasks because it blends technical onboarding with culture transfer and human development. The hybrid nature—both informational (what to do) and relational (how to belong)—makes selective automation more complex. Participants view AI as a good fit for the informational half but not for the relational half.

- Trust and control dynamics: Trust is tied to perceived accuracy and accountability. Developers are wary of granting autonomy to AI for people-facing functions; they prefer tools that increase human control (e.g., AI-generated drafts that require approval) rather than systems that act unilaterally. The desire for oversight also reflects concerns about mentor development and organizational liability.

## 3) Outliers and Edge Cases

- Minority perspectives advocating stronger AI agency: Participant 318 explicitly wants AI that sometimes "take[s] the lead role," which departs from the dominant preference for assistive AI. This suggests a subset of users who may be comfortable with higher AI autonomy—possibly in low-risk or well-defined onboarding scenarios.

- Ambivalent respondents: Some participants express mixed views in the same response. For instance, Participant 385 rejects AI for full mentoring yet lists specific helpful AI functions ("search/finding resources; communication: transcription, summaries; documentation: boilerplate"). These ambivalent positions highlight user desire for nuanced, configurable tool behavior.

- Emphasis on mentor benefit: The "Mentor’s growth and development" theme is an edge case in that it argues against AI not solely for mentee protection but to preserve mentors' formative experiences. This shifts the concern from immediate task accuracy to long-term organizational learning.

- Contradictions within individuals: A few responses implicitly contain contradictions—advocating for AI-generated onboarding plans while simultaneously warning about AI hallucinations in documentation (e.g., Participant 271 and Participant 17). These contradictions indicate that respondents see value in AI-generated artifacts but remain uncertain about reliability, reinforcing the demand for transparency and review mechanisms.

## 4) Implications for AI Tool Design

Designing AI for Mentoring Onboarding requires a balanced, configurable approach that augments human mentors while safeguarding relational and developmental processes. Tools should automate routine, time-consuming tasks (training plans, boilerplate docs, searchable knowledge) but explicitly defer to humans for people-facing judgments, culture transmission, and mentoring relationships. Systems must prioritize transparency, provenance, and human-in-the-loop workflows to address hallucination risks and support mentor learning.

#### Key "Must Haves" (features designers should prioritize)

- **Onboarding plan generation and customizable learning pathways**
  - Capability: Generate role-specific, editable onboarding/training plans and checklists that mentors can review and tailor.
  - Rationale: Participants requested "Auto-generated training plan for new onboardings" (Participant 272) and value AI for creating learning structure (Participant 269).
  
- **Documentation drafting and "brain dump" helpers with edit-trace**
  - Capability: Produce first-draft documentation, boilerplate, and brain-dump summaries with clear citation of sources and an edit history for reviewers.
  - Rationale: Participants want AI to "handle draining but important tasks like writing effective documentation" (Participant 271) and to help "brain dump the knowledge" (Participant 401), but also worry about factual errors.
  
- **Searchable onboarding resource surfacing**
  - Capability: Context-aware search that surfaces relevant docs, code walkthroughs, and people to contact, with confidence scores and provenance.
  - Rationale: Many want help "search/finding resources" (Participant 385) and quick access to onboarding materials.
  
- **Human-in-the-loop workflows and approval gates**
  - Capability: Require mentor approval for any guidance pushed to a mentee; present AI suggestions as draft items flagged for review before use.
  - Rationale: Strong desire for oversight ("there needs to be a human connection"—Participant 70; "AI should definitely not be the primary factor"—Participant 17).
  
- **Contextual limitations and role demarcation controls**
  - Capability: Configurable restrictions to prevent AI from autonomously handling relationship-building tasks or offering prescriptive cultural advice; ability to mark sensitive topics as human-only.
  - Rationale: Participants emphasized that mentoring is "a very cultural task" (Participant 10) and that empathy and nuance are human domains.

#### Key "Must Not Haves" (design guardrails)

- **Autonomous people-facing mentoring**
  - Risk: Allowing AI to act as the primary mentor or to autonomously interact with new hires risks relationship breakdowns and harmful guidance.
  - Rationale/Example: "I don't want it to do mentoring because the cost of it getting it wrong is terrible" (Participant 357).
  
- **Opaque content generation without provenance**
  - Risk: Generated documentation or guidance without citations or edit history undermines trust and increases likelihood of misinformation.
  - Rationale/Example: Participants distrust "a stochastic parrot" for documentation (Participant 385) and worry about hallucinations (Participant 17).
  
- **Removal of mentoring opportunities for human mentors**
  - Risk: Offloading mentoring entirely to AI could erode mentor development and leadership skill cultivation.
  - Rationale/Example: "Mentoring...teaches the mentor as well" (Participant 228).
  
- **Automated cultural or subjective coaching**
  - Risk: Letting AI provide cultural assimilation advice or subjective performance coaching can misinterpret local norms and cause harm.
  - Rationale/Example: "This is a very cultural task that requires human-human communication." (Participant 10)
  
- **Unrestricted AI initiative in onboarding workflows**
  - Risk: Systems that act without explicit human consent (e.g., auto-enrolling a new joiner in tasks or sending guidance) may produce incorrect or contextually inappropriate actions.
  - Rationale/Example: Preference for AI as assistant not replacement ("would not be helpful for AI to do..."—Participant 27; "there needs to be a human connection"—Participant 70).

---

## Executive Summary

- Developers broadly welcome AI for structured, administrative onboarding tasks—creating learning plans, drafting documentation, and surfacing resources—to reduce tedious work and accelerate ramp-up.
- Developers strongly resist replacing human mentors for relationship-building, cultural onboarding, and empathy-driven coaching; these are seen as inherently human responsibilities.
- Design implication: prioritize assistive, human-in-the-loop features (editable training plans, draft docs with provenance, approval gates) rather than autonomous mentoring agents.
- Guardrails needed: avoid autonomous people-facing AI, require provenance for generated content, and preserve mentoring opportunities for human growth.
- Notable tension: conditional acceptance—AI is valuable for rote tasks but trusted only when human oversight is enforced because of hallucination and cultural nuance risks.
- Recommendation: build configurable, transparent onboarding assistants that automate low-risk tasks while explicitly deferring subjective, cultural, and developmental activities to human mentors.
